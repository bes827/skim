Resistant Hypertension Management
    |-- Definition
    |      |-- Blood pressure remains above goal despite three antihypertensive agents of different classes
    |      |-- Blood pressure at goal but requires four or more medications (one must be a diuretic)
    |
    |-- Key Management Step
    |      |-- Add Diuretic
    |      |      |-- Preferred: Chlorthalidone (thiazide diuretic)
    |      |      |      |-- Longer half-life allows once-daily dosing
    |      |      |      |-- Evidence suggests efficacy in reducing cardiovascular events
    |
    |-- Common Pitfalls
    |      |-- Suboptimal therapy often due to lack of diuretic
    |      |      |-- Diuretic prevents or treats extracellular volume expansion
    |
    |-- Evaluation for Secondary Causes
    |      |-- Primary Hyperaldosteronism

    |      |      |-- Daily Correction Rate: <10 mEq/L (10 mmol/L)
    |
    |-- Pathophysiology
    |      |-- Cause: Water Loss during Glucose-Induced Osmotic Diuresis
    |      |-- Consequences: Hypernatremia due to dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities
    |
    |-- Patient Considerations
    |      |-- Confusion: Best to administer water via nasogastric tube
    |      |-- Water Deficit: Approximately 4500 mL
    |
    |-- Treatment Options
    |      |-- Option A: 5% Dextrose
    |      |      |-- Ineffective due to worsening hyperglycemia and osmotic diuresis
    |      |
    |      |-- Option B: 0.45% Normal Saline
    |      |      |-- Requires 9 liters to normalize serum sodium
    |      |
    |      |-- Option C: 0.9% Saline
    |      |      |-- Ineffective for hypernatremia
    |      |      |-- Worsens elevated blood pressure
    |      |      |-- Exacerbates hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis
    |
    |-- Correction Guidelines

    |      |      |-- Dosing: 2-3 times daily
    |      |
    |      |-- ACE Inhibitors / ARBs
    |      |      |-- First-line for advanced CKD or proteinuric CKD
    |      |      |-- Not to combine ACE with ARB due to risk of acute kidney injury and hyperkalemia
    |      |
    |      |-- Calcium Channel Blockers

Antihypertensive Medication Regimen Adjustment
    |-- Strategies for Dose Adjustment
    |      |-- Maximize medication dose before adding another agent
    |      |-- Add another agent before maximizing dose of prior agents
    |
    |-- Recommended Additional Treatment
    |      |-- Amlodipine (CCB) - Option B
    |      |      |-- Indicated for patients whose BP is not at target
    |      |      |-- Target BP: <130/80 mm Hg (2017 ACC/AHA guideline)
    |
    |-- Considerations for Dose Adjustment
    |      |-- Diminishing returns in BP lowering from 50% to 100% of maximum dose
    |      |-- Increasing dose may not yield significant BP reduction
    |      |-- Higher doses may lead to side effects and reduced adherence
    |      |-- Adding a third drug recommended by experts for two-drug regimens
    |
    |-- Drug Combinations to Avoid
    |      |-- Renin-Angiotensin System Blockers
    |      |      |-- ACE inhibitors with ARBs
    |      |      |-- ACE inhibitors or ARBs with aliskiren
    |      |      |-- Risks: Increased cardiovascular and renal risk
    |      |      |-- Aliskiren should not be added - Option A
    |
    |-- Less Preferred Options
    |      |-- Hydralazine - Option C
    |      |      |-- Not preferred due to less evidence of reducing clinical events
    |      |      |-- Thrice-daily dosing increases pill burden
    |      |
    |      |-- Hydrochlorothiazide - Option D
    |      |      |-- Not effective in combination with another thiazide
    |      |      |-- Risk of hypokalemia
    |      |      |-- Different diuretics (thiazide + potassium-sparing + loop) may be effective

Kidney Function Evaluation
    |-- Serum Cystatin C Measurement
    |      |-- More sensitive than serum creatinine for mild decrements in kidney function
    |      |-- Less influenced by age, sex, muscle mass, and body weight
    |      |-- Produced by all nucleated cells
    |      |-- Completely filtered by glomeruli and metabolized by renal tubules
    |      |-- Index of GFR
    |
    |-- Serum Creatinine Measurement
    |      |-- Altered by muscle mass
    |      |      |-- Increased muscle mass → elevated serum creatinine
    |      |      |-- Decreased muscle mass → underestimates kidney function in older persons
    |      |-- Overestimates kidney function in older persons, especially women
    |
    |-- Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) (Option A)
    |      |-- Derived from protein metabolism
    |      |-- Poor marker of kidney function
    |      |      |-- Not produced at a constant rate

    |      |      |-- Influenced by renal blood flow
    |
    |-- Creatinine Clearance Measurement (Option B)
    |      |-- Direct measurement tends to overestimate GFR
    |      |-- 24-hour urine collection can estimate GFR
    |      |      |-- Prone to collection errors
    |      |      |-- Unnecessarily burdensome for patients
    |
    |-- Radionuclide Imaging (Option C)
    |      |-- Gold standard for GFR measurement in research
    |      |-- Useful for kidney donor evaluation and differential GFR assessment
    |      |-- Unnecessary for this patient due to availability of serum cystatin C
