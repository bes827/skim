Manage vaccinations in patients with chronic kidney disease.  
- Patients with CKD and ESKD should receive either the 20-valent or 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine followed by the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine.  ***
- Annual influenza vaccination is crucial due to increased morbidity and mortality risks in CKD patients.  

Additional clinically relevant information:  
- In adults aged 19 to 64 with CKD, pneumococcal vaccination with PCV20 or both PCV15 and PPSV23 is indicated.  
- If administering PCV15 and PPSV23, give PCV15 first, followed by PPSV23 at least 8 weeks later.  
- Patients with CKD should receive hepatitis B vaccination if not already immune, especially those on hemodialysis.  
- Hepatitis A vaccination is indicated for CKD patients traveling to endemic areas or at risk for infection.  
- The herpes zoster vaccine is recommended for adults over 50 years, following general population guidelines.  

Potential serious clinical pitfalls:  
- Overlooking the need for pneumococcal vaccination in CKD patients.  
- Neglecting annual influenza vaccination can lead to increased hospitalization and mortality.  
- Failing to vaccinate against hepatitis B in at-risk patients, even if they are on hemodialysis.  
- Incorrect timing of pneumococcal vaccines can diminish immune response.





Contrast-Associated Acute Tubular Necrosis  
- Contrast-associated nephropathy (CAN) leads to acute tubular necrosis (ATN).  
- Characterized by a rise in serum creatinine 24 to 48 hours post-contrast exposure.  

Additional Clinically Relevant Information:  
- Risk factors for CAN include chronic kidney injury, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and large volume contrast exposure.  
- Typical laboratory findings: BUN-creatinine ratio of 15:1, urine specific gravity of 1.010, urine sodium >40 mEq/L, and urine sediment may show granular casts.  
- Atheroembolic-induced acute kidney injury is characterized by a delayed rise in serum creatinine, often with external signs like livedo reticularis.  
- Clopidogrel can cause hemolytic uremic syndrome, but this typically presents with significant anemia and thrombocytopenia.  
- Prerenal acute kidney injury is unlikely without hypovolemia signs and usually has a BUN-creatinine ratio >20:1.  

Potential Serious Clinical Pitfalls:  
- Misdiagnosing CAN as prerenal acute kidney injury due to overlapping symptoms.  
- Delayed recognition of atheroembolic injury, leading to inappropriate management.  
- Overlooking the significance of urine sodium levels in diagnosing ATN.





Salicylate Toxicity Treatment  
  - Intravenous sodium bicarbonate is the most appropriate treatment. It increases urinary elimination of salicylate and protects against CNS toxicity.  ***
  - A urine pH goal of >7.5 is essential for effective treatment to trap salicylic acid in the renal tubule and promote its excretion.  
  - Maintaining serum pH at 7.50 to 7.55 is crucial to prevent CNS accumulation of salicylic acid.  

Additional Clinically Relevant Information  
  - Salicylate toxicity can present as respiratory alkalosis or mixed acid-base disorders, including anion gap metabolic acidosis.  
  - Acetazolamide is contraindicated; it may lead to systemic acidosis and increase CNS salicylate levels.  
  - Hemodialysis is indicated for serum salicylate levels >90-100 µg/mL in acute intoxication or >60 µg/mL in chronic cases, along with specific clinical conditions.  ***
  - Forced diuresis with 0.9% saline is ineffective without systemic and urinary alkalinization.  

Potential Serious Clinical Pitfalls  
  - Misuse of acetazolamide can worsen CNS toxicity.  
  - Delaying hemodialysis in severe cases can lead to complications like cerebral edema or severe mental status alterations.  
  - Failure to achieve target urine and serum pH can result in inadequate salicylate elimination.





Lupus Nephritis Diagnosis  
- Kidney biopsy is the definitive diagnostic test for lupus nephritis.  
- Histologic findings from the biopsy guide treatment decisions.  

Additional Clinically Relevant Information:  
- The 2019 EULAR/ACR classification criteria for SLE require a positive ANA, at least one clinical criterion, and ≥10 points for diagnosis.  
- This patient has a positive ANA, acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and low serum complement levels, totaling 10 points.  
- Lupus nephritis is classified into six distinct histologic classes, which influence treatment strategies.  
- Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) helps gauge disease activity but does not determine the class of lupus nephritis.  
- Extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) panel tests are not necessary for SLE diagnosis and do not alter treatment plans compared to kidney biopsy results.  

Potential Serious Clinical Pitfalls:  
- Misdiagnosing lupus nephritis without a kidney biopsy can lead to inappropriate treatment.  
- Relying solely on ESR or ENA panel results may delay definitive diagnosis and management.  
- Skin biopsy is unnecessary in the presence of classic clinical findings for acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus.





Renal Replacement Therapy Education for End-Stage Kidney Disease  
  - Patients with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m² should be referred for RRT education.  
  - RRT education enables informed decisions about modalities like hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and kidney transplantation.  

Additional Clinically Relevant Information:  
  - Early education may lead to a higher likelihood of choosing home dialysis or preemptive kidney transplantation.  
  - Patients who receive preparatory RRT education may experience a mortality benefit compared to those who do not.  
  - AVF placement is indicated only after the decision to proceed with hemodialysis is made.  
  - Referral for kidney transplant evaluation is optimal when eGFR is 15-29 mL/min/1.73 m² to improve clinical outcomes.  ***
  - Preemptive kidney transplants are associated with better outcomes than transplants after starting dialysis.  

Potential Serious Clinical Pitfalls:  
  - Delaying RRT education can lead to emergent dialysis initiation.  
  - Failure to refer for transplant evaluation at the appropriate eGFR may hinder timely access to transplantation options.  
  - Starting dialysis in asymptomatic patients may not provide benefits over watchful waiting.





Calciphylaxis in End-Stage Kidney Disease  
  - Calciphylaxis is characterized by calcifications in dermal arterioles, leading to painful ischemic skin lesions.  
  - It is a serious complication of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) with a high risk of mortality due to secondary infections and sepsis.  ***

Additional Clinically Relevant Information:  
  - Patients often have severe secondary hyperparathyroidism and elevated calcium-phosphorous product, but those with normalized serum levels are also at risk.  ***
  - There are no FDA-approved treatments for calciphylaxis; however, calcimimetics can suppress parathyroid hormone levels.  
  - Sodium thiosulfate is commonly used and has anti-inflammatory properties.  
  - Calciphylaxis is increasingly recognized in the dialysis community, highlighting the need for awareness among clinicians.  

Potential Serious Clinical Pitfalls:  
  - Misdiagnosis can occur if calciphylaxis is confused with leukocytoclastic vasculitis or venous stasis ulcers.  
  - Rapidly advancing ulcers with necrosis should raise suspicion for calciphylaxis rather than typical venous ulcers.  
  - Warfarin-related necrosis may be misinterpreted; it usually presents with thrombosis rather than calcifications.





Fibromuscular Dysplasia  
- Typically occurs in young persons, especially women <35 years of age.  
- Characterized by abrupt onset of hypertension and may present with an abdominal bruit.  
- Renal artery CT angiography (CTA) is the initial imaging modality of choice for diagnosis.  

Additional Clinically Relevant Information:  
- Fibromuscular dysplasia is a noninflammatory, nonatherosclerotic condition affecting medium-sized arteries.  
- Patients are at risk for aneurysm formation and/or dissection, commonly in renal, carotid, and intracranial arteries.  
- A one-time assessment for intracranial aneurysm is recommended using brain CTA or MRA.  
- Contrast-enhanced MRA is an alternative if CTA is contraindicated.  
- Duplex ultrasound may be used in specialized centers with expertise in this imaging modality.  

Potential Serious Clinical Pitfalls:  
- Misdiagnosis can occur if primary hyperaldosteronism is assumed without hypokalemia or metabolic alkalosis.  
- Pheochromocytoma may be incorrectly considered if symptoms like palpitations or headaches are not present.  
- Failing to assess for intracranial aneurysm in patients with fibromuscular dysplasia can lead to serious complications.***





Type 4 (Hyperkalemic Distal) Renal Tubular Acidosis  
- Commonly caused by diabetes mellitus.  
- Characterized by hyperkalemia, normal anion gap metabolic acidosis, and urine pH <5.5.  

Additional Clinically Relevant Information:  
- Drug-induced type 4 RTA can occur from ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, heparin, and NSAIDs.  
- Type 4 RTA results from aldosterone deficiency or resistance; hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism is more common, especially in diabetes.  
- Patients have a positive urine anion gap due to reduced ammonium excretion, leading to low urine pH.  
- Metabolic acidosis typically develops when GFR <40 mL/min/1.73 m² in chronic kidney disease.  ***
- Diarrhea causes a negative urine anion gap, differentiating it from type 4 RTA.  

Potential Serious Clinical Pitfalls:  
- Confusing type 4 RTA with chronic kidney disease, where acidosis typically occurs at lower GFR.  
- Misinterpreting the urine anion gap; a positive gap indicates type 4 RTA, while a negative gap suggests diarrhea.  
- Overlooking the role of medication in causing hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis.





Acute Tubular Necrosis Due to Rhabdomyolysis  
  - Rhabdomyolysis leads to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) primarily through myoglobin toxicity and renal vasoconstriction.  
  - Elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) levels, particularly >5000 U/L, are indicative of rhabdomyolysis.  

Additional Clinically Relevant Information:  
  - Associated electrolyte imbalances include hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hyperuricemia.  
  - Urinary findings include pigmented granular casts, myoglobinuria, and a urine dipstick positive for blood without significant erythrocytes.  
  - Fractional excretion of sodium <1% suggests renal vasoconstriction due to ATN.  
  - Rhabdomyolysis can occur after extreme physical exertion, especially in inadequately conditioned individuals.  

Potential Serious Clinical Pitfalls:  
  - Confusion with immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy, which does not cause ATN.  
  - Misdiagnosis with inflammatory myopathies, which typically present without renal involvement.  
  - Overlooking the risk of acute kidney injury in patients with elevated CK levels and muscle symptoms.





Manage Chronic Hypertension Before Conception  
- Discontinue renin-angiotensin system blocking agents (ACE inhibitors, ARBs, direct renin inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists) before conception due to contraindications in pregnancy.  
- Maintain systolic blood pressure <140 mm Hg and diastolic pressure <90 mm Hg in pregnant patients, per ACOG and SMFM guidelines.  

Additional Clinically Relevant Information:  
- The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) updated the blood pressure threshold in 2022 based on the Chronic Hypertension and Pregnancy trial.  
- Safe antihypertensive alternatives during pregnancy include labetalol, nifedipine, and methyldopa.  ***
- Exposure to renin-angiotensin system blockers during the second and third trimesters is associated with neonatal kidney failure and death.  ***
- Discontinuing contraindicated antihypertensives should be followed by initiating a safe alternative to prevent blood pressure spikes.  

Potential Serious Clinical Pitfalls:  
- Not discontinuing ramipril before conception can lead to unsafe maternal and fetal outcomes.  
- Preemptively stopping antihypertensive therapy without a safe replacement may result in uncontrolled hypertension.





Nonglomerular Causes of Increased Serum Creatinine Levels  
- Some medications can reduce proximal tubule secretion of creatinine.  
- Drugs such as cimetidine, trimethoprim, cobicistat, dolutegravir, and bictegravir can cause nonprogressive increases in serum creatinine without affecting GFR.  

Clinically Relevant Information:  
- Serum creatinine may increase by 0.2 to 0.3 mg/dL (17.7-26.5 µmol/L) with these medications.  
- In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), creatinine secretion contributes more to creatinine clearance.  
- In CKD patients, serum creatinine elevations from integrase inhibitors or cobicistat stabilize within 1 to 2 weeks of initiation.  
- Absence of other kidney disease signs (hematuria, pyuria, increasing proteinuria) indicates no further evaluation is necessary.  
- Serum cystatin C level can be a helpful confirmatory test as it is not affected by these medications.  

Potential Serious Clinical Pitfalls:  
- Discontinuing antihypertensive medications like lisinopril-hydrochlorothiazide may be unnecessary.  
- A 24-hour urine creatinine clearance may be misleading due to drug-related lower creatinine secretion.  
- Returning to a prior antiretroviral regimen is not warranted if serum creatinine changes are not indicative of GFR decline.





Resistant Hypertension  
  - Resistant hypertension is defined as blood pressure above goal despite three antihypertensive agents of different classes or controlled BP requiring four or more medications, one of which must be a diuretic.  
  - The first-line treatment for resistant hypertension is to add a thiazide diuretic, preferably chlorthalidone, due to its longer half-life and efficacy in reducing cardiovascular events.  ***

Additional Clinically Relevant Information:  
  - Hydrochlorothiazide is commonly used but chlorthalidone may be more effective for once-daily dosing.  
  - Primary hyperaldosteronism should be suspected in cases of sustained hypertension over 150/100 mm Hg on three medications, resistant hypertension, or hypertension with hypokalemia.  
  - Testing for plasma aldosterone concentration/plasma renin activity ratio is unnecessary without clinical suspicion of primary hyperaldosteronism.  
  - Pheochromocytoma screening via plasma fractionated metanephrines is indicated only with specific clinical signs, such as paroxysmal hypertension or episodic symptoms.  
  - Renal artery imaging is not warranted without signs of renal artery stenosis, such as severe hypertension in older patients or acute kidney injury after starting certain antihypertensives.  

Potential Serious Clinical Pitfalls:  
  - Failing to add a diuretic before diagnosing resistant hypertension may delay appropriate management.  
  - Misdiagnosing or over-testing for secondary causes of hypertension without clear indications can lead to unnecessary procedures and anxiety.  
  - Ignoring the potential for primary hyperaldosteronism in patients with resistant hypertension may result in inadequate treatment.





Abdominal Compartment Syndrome  
- Defined as sustained intra-abdominal pressure >20 mm Hg with at least one organ dysfunction.  ***
- Diagnosis confirmed via bladder pressure measurement as a surrogate for intra-abdominal pressure.  

Additional Clinically Relevant Information:  
- Consider in settings like abdominal surgery, trauma, intra-abdominal bleeding, ascites, bowel obstruction, ileus, or pancreatitis.  
- Can result from capillary leak due to sepsis and massive fluid resuscitation.  
- Surgical decompression is the appropriate treatment for abdominal compartment syndrome.  
- Bladder pressure measurement is the most direct and relevant diagnostic test in suspected cases.  

Potential Serious Clinical Pitfalls:  
- Relying on imaging tests like CT urography or MRI, which are not useful for diagnosing ACS.  
- Delaying bladder pressure measurement may lead to worsened organ dysfunction.  
- Misdiagnosing symptoms due to other conditions, potentially overlooking ACS.





Isovolemic Hypernatremia Treatment  
- The primary treatment is water, administered orally or via nasogastric tube if the patient cannot drink.  ***
- Correct serum sodium levels at a rate of <10 mEq/L (10 mmol/L) daily.  ***
- For every 100-mg/dL (5.6-mmol/L) decrease in serum glucose, serum sodium increases by approximately 2.0 mEq/L (2.0 mmol/L).  

Additional Clinically Relevant Information:  
- The patient’s water deficit is approximately 4500 mL.  
- Administration of 5% dextrose may worsen hyperglycemia and increase water losses due to osmotic diuresis.  
- 0.45% normal saline requires at least 9 liters to correct hypernatremia effectively.  
- 0.9% saline will not improve hypernatremia and may worsen hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.  
- Most authorities recommend a maximum decrease of serum sodium by 10 mEq/L (10 mmol/L) daily to avoid complications.  

Potential Serious Clinical Pitfalls:  
- Rapid correction of serum sodium can lead to serious complications.  
- Administering glucose-containing solutions in hyperglycemic patients can exacerbate hyperglycemia and further dehydration.  
- Using isotonic saline in hypernatremic patients may worsen their condition and blood pressure.





Hypertension Management in Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease  
- Loop diuretics, like furosemide, are indicated for hypertension in advanced CKD.  ***
- ACE inhibitors and ARBs are first-line treatments but should not be combined due to risks.  

Additional Clinically Relevant Information:  
- Patients with stage G4 CKD may have an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <30 mL/min/1.73 m².  
- Thiazide diuretics are ineffective in patients with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m².  ***
- Suboptimal blood pressure control often arises from not including diuretics in treatment.  
- Jugular venous distention and lower extremity edema indicate a sodium-retentive state.  

Potential Serious Clinical Pitfalls:  
- Combining an ACE inhibitor with an ARB can lead to acute kidney injury and hyperkalemia.  
- β-blockers do not address expanded extracellular volume and are inappropriate without compelling indications.  
- Hydralazine may worsen extracellular volume expansion and lead to inadequate blood pressure control.





Manage venous access for a patient with chronic kidney disease.  
  - Avoid peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min/1.73 m².  ***
  - Internal jugular vein insertion of a central venous catheter is preferred for venous access.  
  - Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the safest and most durable option for future renal replacement therapy.  

Additional clinically relevant information:  
  - AVFs have superior clinical outcomes compared to arteriovenous grafts.  ***
  - PICC lines are associated with a 15% to 20% lower likelihood of transitioning to a working fistula or graft.  ***
  - Long-term use of PICC lines increases the risk of death.  
  - Central venous catheters via the internal jugular vein are less prone to stenosis than subclavian catheters.  
  - Protect the nondominant arm's veins by limiting phlebotomy and IV catheters for future AVF success.  

Potential serious clinical pitfalls:  
  - PICC lines can cause significant trauma and venous stenosis, impairing AVF maturation and function.  
  - Subclavian catheters can lead to subclavian stenosis, affecting dialysis access.  
  - Central venous stenosis can occur with internal jugular catheters, but they are still preferred over PICCs and subclavian catheters.





{Anti–glomerular basement membrane antibody disease}  
- Characterized by necrotizing & crescentic glomerulonephritis with linear IgG staining on immunofluorescence.  
- Diagnosis confirmed by measuring anti-GBM antibodies; used to monitor treatment response.  

- RPGN defined as acute & steep rise in serum creatinine + hematuria + proteinuria.  
- Differential diagnosis includes: *** 
  - Pauci-immune staining (ANCA-mediated GN)  
  - Linear staining (anti-GBM GN)  
  - Granular staining (lupus nephritis)  
- >50% of patients may have lung involvement (Goodpasture syndrome***); hemoptysis can be a presenting symptom.  
- Up to 1 in 3 patients may have positive ANCA serologies, usually anti-MPO antibodies; more common in older women.  
- Successful treatment typically includes glucocorticoids, plasmapheresis, & cyclophosphamide; eradicates serum anti-GBM antibody titer.  

**Potential serious clinical pitfalls:**  
- Testing for anti-dsDNA antibodies not required if ANA is negative & no granular staining on biopsy.  
- Anti-PLA2R antibodies not indicated unless primary membranous nephropathy is suspected.  ***
- IgA nephropathy diagnosis requires specific biopsy findings; circulating IgA levels not useful.





IgG4-Related Disease (IgG4-RD)  
- Patients often present with sentinel organ enlargement & dysfunction.  
- Kidney involvement typically shows chronic interstitial nephritis (CIN) with fibrosis & lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate.  

- Diagnosis: tissue biopsy shows dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, CD4-positive T cells, IgG4-positive plasma cells, storiform fibrosis, obliterative phlebitis/arteritis, & tissue eosinophilia.  
- Serum IgG4 levels are elevated in 70-80% of patients; normal levels do not exclude disease.  
- Initial treatment: prednisone.  
- Common presentations: idiopathic pancreatitis, sclerosing cholangitis, bilateral salivary/lacrimal gland enlargement, retroperitoneal fibrosis, orbital pseudotumor, proptosis.  

**Potential serious clinical pitfalls:**  
- Misdiagnosis can occur with sarcoidosis, SLE, or TINU.  
- Sarcoidosis does not explain idiopathic pancreatitis or lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate on biopsy.  
- SLE more often presents as acute glomerular disease & is not associated with pancreatitis.  
- TINU is distinct & typically occurs in adolescents/young women, inconsistent with this patient's presentation.





{multiple myeloma as a cause of isotonic hyponatremia}  
- Step 1 in hyponatremia evaluation: measure serum osmolality.  
- Isotonic hyponatremia = lab artifact from ↑ plasma lipids/proteins.  ***

- Likely cause: multiple myeloma (supporting labs: ↑ serum calcium, anemia, ↑ total protein, low albumin, ↑ gamma globulin fraction).  
- Normal serum osmolality = isotonic hyponatremia (275-295 mOsm/kg H2O).  
- Diluting electrode method can cause spurious sodium values due to ↓ water phase (from ↑ solid phase).  
- Hypercalcemia causes polyuria & ↑ sodium, not hyponatremia.  ***
- Decreased solute intake (e.g., potomania/starvation) leads to hyponatremia with urine osmolality <100 mOsm/kg H2O.  
- Psychogenic polydipsia = excess water intake; urine osmolality <100 mOsm/kg H2O.  
- SIADH = always low measured serum osmolality; hypo-osmolar hyponatremia.  

Potential serious clinical pitfalls:  
- Misinterpretation of isotonic hyponatremia as true hyponatremia can lead to inappropriate treatment.  
- Failing to recognize multiple myeloma as a cause may delay diagnosis & management.  
- Confusion between different causes of hyponatremia can result in incorrect management strategies.





{Surreptitious Vomiting and Metabolic Alkalosis}  
- Saline-responsive metabolic alkalosis: low urine chloride <15 mEq/L; common causes: vomiting, nasogastric suction, diuretics.  
- High urine chloride >15 mEq/L + hypertension + hypokalemia -> evaluate for mineralocorticoid excess disorders (Cushing syndrome, primary hyperaldosteronism).  
- Diagnosis: metabolic alkalosis via elevated serum bicarbonate & pH; caused by loss of acid or retention of bicarbonate.  

- Laboratory evaluation: urine chloride concentration critical for diagnosis.  
- Hypokalemia occurs due to aldosterone elevation & renal bicarbonate loss.  
- Bartter syndrome & Gitelman syndrome: present with hypokalemic alkalosis & urine chloride >15 mEq/L; not applicable here.  
- Chronic hypertension may mask hypovolemia; patients can present with normal/high blood pressure despite volume contraction.  

- Clinical pitfalls: misdiagnosing metabolic alkalosis due to low urine chloride as mineralocorticoid excess disorders; overlooking chronic hypertension in hypovolemic patients.





{Management of End-Stage Kidney Disease with Dialysis}  
- Late presentation of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) must be part of the differential diagnosis for acute kidney injury.  
- Small (<10 cm) echogenic kidneys on ultrasound are indicative of advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD).  

- Initiation of dialysis is the most appropriate management for symptoms of uremia & severe metabolic acidosis.  
- History & physical exam may not distinguish between acute & chronic kidney disease; ultrasound is key.  
- Rapid volume challenge (IV 0.9% saline) is contraindicated in ESKD due to risk of heart failure.  
- High-dose glucocorticoids (e.g., methylprednisolone) are ineffective in advanced CKD; indicated only in acute glomerulonephritis.  
- Percutaneous kidney biopsy is not practical in small echogenic kidneys & has increased bleeding risk.  

Potential Serious Clinical Pitfalls:  
- Misdiagnosing ESKD as acute kidney injury can delay appropriate treatment.  
- Administering IV fluids in ESKD patients may exacerbate heart failure.  
- Inappropriate use of glucocorticoids in advanced CKD can lead to unnecessary complications.  
- Performing kidney biopsy in patients with small kidneys increases risk of bleeding without benefit.





{Adjusting Antihypertensive Medication Regimen}  
- Maximize medication dose before adding another agent or add another agent before maximizing the dose.  
- Use drugs from different classes to avoid reduced efficacy & potential harm.  

- Amlodipine (CCB) is the best option for additional treatment if BP is not at target (<130/80 mm Hg).  
- Two drugs from the same BP control system (e.g., ACEi + ARB) increase cardiovascular & renal risk.  
- Titrating from 50% to 100% of maximum dose yields diminishing returns in BP lowering & increases side effects.  ***
- Long-acting agents with once-daily dosing improve adherence compared to thrice-daily medications.  
- Combining thiazide diuretics does not enhance BP control & risks hypokalemia; different mechanism diuretics can be effective.  

Potential Serious Clinical Pitfalls:  
- Combining renin-angiotensin system blockers can lead to increased cardiovascular & renal risks.  
- Increasing doses may reduce adherence due to side effects.  
- Using multiple thiazide diuretics does not improve BP control.





{Diagnosing Nephrolithiasis During Pregnancy}  
- Ultrasonography is the preferred initial diagnostic test for nephrolithiasis in pregnant patients.  
- MRI can be used, but is not optimal for kidney stones; ultrasonography is preferred.  

- Ultrasonography is safe, inexpensive, & avoids radiation exposure.  
- Noncontrast helical abdominal CT is more sensitive but contraindicated in pregnancy due to radiation.  
- Plain abdominal radiography has limited utility & should be avoided in pregnancy.  
- A positive ultrasound may suffice for diagnosis in typical presentations; more complex cases require further evaluation.  
- Ureteroscopy is invasive & not indicated for diagnosis; it’s used for management of stones.  

Potential Serious Clinical Pitfalls:  
- Relying on CT in pregnant patients can lead to harmful radiation exposure.  
- Misinterpreting nondiagnostic ultrasound results may delay appropriate management.  
- Failing to consider stone composition can impact treatment choices.





{Tumor Lysis Syndrome and Acute Kidney Injury}  
- TLS can occur spontaneously in acute leukemia/high-grade lymphoma patients.  
- Characterized by acute kidney injury, severe hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia.  
- Prompt isotonic volume expansion + rasburicase is crucial for treatment.  

- Rasburicase rapidly lowers serum urate levels by converting urate to more soluble allantoin.  
- Allopurinol prevents new urate formation but does not quickly lower existing levels.  ***
- Febuxostat is less effective than rasburicase for rapid urate reduction; used when allopurinol is contraindicated.  ***
- Urinary alkalinization's role is controversial; it can precipitate calcium phosphate.  

- Serious complications: cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, death due to electrolyte imbalances.  
- TLS is most common in highly proliferative hematologic malignancies; early recognition & management are key.





{Nephrolithiasis Imaging Evaluation}  
- Noncontrast helical abdomen & pelvis CT (Option D) = most sensitive imaging test for nephrolithiasis.  
- Sensitivity > 95% for diagnosing nephrolithiasis; detects stones independent of composition (except indinavir crystals).  ***

- IVP (Option A) = no role in kidney stone evaluation; high sensitivity for hydronephrosis but lower than noncontrast CT.  
- Kidney ultrasonography (Option B) = sensitivity 50%-90%; less accurate for small stones & ureteral stones; preferred if CT is unavailable or in pregnancy.  
- Radiography (Option C) = poor sensitivity/specificity; cannot detect radiolucent uric acid stones; useful for monitoring stone movement & growth.  

- Pitfall: Relying on IVP = missing nephrolithiasis diagnosis; ultrasound may miss small/ureteral stones; radiography cannot determine calcification location.





{Metabolic Acidosis in Chronic Kidney Disease}  
- Sodium bicarbonate supplement is the appropriate treatment for metabolic acidosis in CKD.  
- Initiate bicarbonate therapy when serum bicarbonate <22 mEq/L (22 mmol/L).  ***

- Repletion of bicarbonate can slow CKD progression & reduce mortality.  
- Bicarbonate can be administered as tablets, powder (baking soda), or through a diet rich in fruits/vegetables.  
- ESAs should be used cautiously; only for hemoglobin <10 g/dL (100 g/L) & symptomatic.  
- Hemodialysis is not indicated until advanced stage G5 CKD with uremic symptoms.  
- A high-protein diet increases daily acid load & worsens metabolic acidosis.  ***

**Potential Serious Clinical Pitfalls:**  
- ESAs have FDA black box warnings for increased mortality, thromboembolic events, & serious cardiovascular risks.  
- Avoid hemodialysis initiation based on CKD stage alone; monitor for uremic symptoms.  
- Mismanagement of dietary protein can exacerbate metabolic acidosis.





Thin Glomerular Basement Membrane Disease  
- Inheritance: autosomal dominant  
- Causes: inherited type IV collagen abnormality → thinning of GBM → hematuria (usually no proteinuria or abnormal kidney function)  

Additional Clinically Relevant Info:  
- Prevalence: affects up to 5% of the population  
- Family History: ~50% report family history of hematuria without kidney failure  
- Onset: hematuria can be microscopic/macroscopic; first manifests in young adulthood  
- Diagnosis: can be made via kidney biopsy, but not usually required if clinical/family history is strong  
- Genetic testing: may aid in diagnosis  

Potential Serious Clinical Pitfalls:  
- Misdiagnosis as other conditions (e.g., Alport syndrome, Fabry disease) due to overlapping symptoms  
- Over-reliance on kidney biopsy when clinical history is sufficient  
- Failure to recognize familial patterns leading to delayed diagnosis





Hypertension Management in Older Adults  
- SBP goal for patients ≥65: <130 mm Hg (ACC/AHA) vs <150 mm Hg (ACP/AAFP).  
- High-risk patients >60: consider SBP <140 mm Hg to reduce stroke/cardiac events.  

- Chlorthalidone = preferred second-line agent; works by different mechanism than first-line.  
- ACE inhibitor/ARB combos not recommended; α-blockers (e.g., prazosin) are less effective.  
- No evidence of superiority among antihypertensives for patients with PAD.  

- Continuing current therapy may increase cardiovascular event risk in older patients.  
- SBP reduction to <130-140 mm Hg likely exceeds harms in high-risk older adults.  

Potential Serious Clinical Pitfalls:  
- Switching from lisinopril to ramipril lacks evidence of benefit.  
- Ignoring individual risk factors may lead to inadequate management of hypertension.  
- Overlooking the need for a second agent in high-risk patients could result in adverse outcomes.





{Diagnosis of Membranous Nephropathy}  
- Serologic testing for anti-PLA2R antibodies → nearly 100% specificity for primary membranous nephropathy.  
- Anti-PLA2R testing can eliminate the need for kidney biopsy in patients with preserved kidney function & no evidence of secondary causes.  
- Patients with nephrotic syndrome & venous thromboembolism likely have membranous nephropathy; thrombotic complications occur in up to 25% of cases.  

- Risk for clotting ↑ when serum albumin <2.8 g/dL; increases proportionally with decreasing albumin levels.  
- ANCA-associated vasculitis presents with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis; not applicable here due to absence of rapid decline in kidney function & urine microscopy findings.  
- Anti-dsDNA antibodies → specific for lupus; normal complement & negative ANA testing rule out lupus nephritis as a secondary cause.  
- Kidney biopsy in patients with venous thromboembolism is high risk; anti-PLA2R testing should be prioritized.  

**Potential Serious Clinical Pitfalls:**  
- Misdiagnosing ANCA-associated vasculitis due to absence of characteristic findings.  
- Delaying diagnosis by performing unnecessary kidney biopsy in high-risk patients.  
- Failing to recognize the thrombotic risk associated with low serum albumin levels.





{Hypophosphatemia}  
- Ferric carboxymaltose can cause transient hypophosphatemia, even after a single dose.  
- Risk factors for severe hypophosphatemia: vitamin D deficiency, malnutrition, GI disease, medications binding phosphorus.  

- Mechanism: Increased FGF-23 -> phosphaturia & decreased 1-hydroxylation of vitamin D.  
- Other causes of hypophosphatemia: hungry bone syndrome, refeeding syndrome, oncogenic osteomalacia, X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets.  
- Low phosphorus diet does not typically cause hypophosphatemia; renal wasting indicated by high fractional excretion of phosphorus.  
- Metabolic acidosis has minimal effect on phosphorus levels; does not cause hypophosphatemia.  
- Prednisone does not typically cause hypophosphatemia despite its effects on muscle & vitamin D metabolism.  

**Potential serious clinical pitfalls:**  
- Misattributing hypophosphatemia to dietary intake when renal wasting is present.  
- Overlooking risk factors in patients receiving ferric carboxymaltose.  
- Confusing metabolic acidosis with respiratory alkalosis without proper assessment.





{Primary Hyperaldosteronism Management}  
- Eplerenone therapy is the next step for resistant hypertension with confirmed primary hyperaldosteronism.   
- Plasma aldosterone concentration/plasma renin activity ratio >20 + aldosterone ≥15 ng/dL indicates primary aldosteronism.  


 low bp-> renin->activates angiotensin -> inc aldosterone
https://img.grepmed.com/uploads/3488/secondary-hyperaldosteronism-comparison-table-mimics-original.png 

- Bilateral adrenal vein sampling (AVS) distinguishes unilateral adenoma from bilateral hyperplasia; not indicated if surgical management is not pursued.  
- Diffuse bilateral adrenal hyperplasia accounts for ~66% of primary hyperaldosteronism cases.  
- CT is preferred over MRI for adrenal gland assessment due to superior spatial resolution.  
- Oral sodium loading test confirms autonomous aldosterone secretion but requires blood pressure control & hypokalemia correction first.  

- **Clinical Pitfalls:**  
  - Avoid adrenal vein sampling if the patient is not a surgical candidate.  
  - Initiating oral sodium loading prematurely can lead to inaccurate results.





{mixed acid-base disorder diagnosis}  
- Identify the likely dominant acid-base disorder first.  
- Assess the compensatory response to determine if a mixed disorder is present.  

- pH of 7.4 suggests mixed acid-base disorder; normal pH with abnormal bicarbonate indicates this.  
- PCO2 of 27 mm Hg indicates respiratory alkalosis; expected metabolic compensation is a decrease in bicarbonate by 4-5 mEq/L for each 10 mm Hg decrease in PCO2.  
- Expected bicarbonate range: 17.5-18.8 mEq/L; patient's bicarbonate is 16 mEq/L, indicating concurrent normal gap metabolic acidosis.  
- Anion gap of 7 is normal (8.0-10 mEq/L), ruling out increased anion gap metabolic acidosis.  

- Clinical pitfalls:  
  - Misinterpreting normal pH as absence of disorder; it may indicate mixed disorder.  
  - Overlooking concurrent metabolic acidosis when bicarbonate is lower than expected compensatory levels.  
  - Confusing respiratory alkalosis with chronic compensation without recognizing additional metabolic acidosis.





{Hepatitis C Virus Infection and Cryoglobulinemic Glomerulonephritis}  
- HCV infection is linked to cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis.  
- Treatment involves direct-acting antiviral drugs.  

- Most appropriate viral study: HCV antibody testing → if positive, measure viral load & genotyping.  
- Clinical presentation: purpuric rash, low complement levels, positive rheumatoid factor, positive cryoglobulins.  
- Biopsy likely reveals membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN).  
- Cryoglobulinemia types: Type I = monoclonal Ig (usually IgM); Type II & III = mixed cryoglobulinemia (polyclonal IgG & monoclonal/polyclonal IgM).  
- Mixed cryoglobulinemia is common with HCV, cutaneous symptoms in 70%-90% of patients.  
- Peripheral neuropathy (60%), arthritis (40%), glomerulonephritis (40%) are common manifestations.  
- Global HCV prevalence: 2%-3%, but >10% in Egypt.  

- Potential serious clinical pitfalls:  
  - Hepatitis A, B, and HIV infections are not associated with cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis.  
  - Misdiagnosing nephritic syndrome as HBV or HIV-related glomerular diseases can lead to inappropriate treatment.





{Management of Hypertension in Chronic Kidney Disease}  
- Sodium retention & volume overload contribute to hypertension in CKD.  
- Loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) preferred over thiazides when eGFR <20-30 mL/min/1.73 m².  
- Dietary sodium restriction <2000 mg/d is essential for BP control in advanced CKD.  

- Hydrochlorothiazide ineffective in advanced CKD; elevated BP & edema indicate need for change.  
- Eplerenone & other potassium-sparing diuretics are weaker diuretics; risk of hyperkalemia when combined with ACE inhibitors.  
- BP goal for adults with CKD & hypertension: <130/80 mm Hg (ACC/AHA guidelines).  
- Higher diuretic doses needed due to decreased GFR in CKD patients.  

**Potential Serious Clinical Pitfalls:**  
- Continuing ineffective treatment (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide) can worsen BP, edema, & hyperkalemia.  
- Dual renin-angiotensin system inhibition increases serum potassium risk.  
- Not addressing sodium retention may lead to inadequate BP control.





{Proteinuria Evaluation}  
- Significant proteinuria detected via urine protein-creatinine ratio while urine dipstick or UA are negative -> suggests nonalbumin proteinuria.  
- Nonalbumin proteinuria may include low-molecular-weight proteins, monoclonal immunoglobulins/light chains, myoglobin, & hemoglobin.  

- Urine protein electrophoresis is the most appropriate next test for diagnosis.  
- Discrepancy between urine dipstick & protein-creatinine ratio raises concern for nonalbumin proteins.  
- Normocytic, normochromic anemia may indicate multiple myeloma; further testing is warranted.  
- Traditional 24-hour urine collection is less feasible; random urine protein/creatinine ratios are preferred for quantification.  
- Sulsosalicylic acid test detects nonalbumin proteins but does not specify types present.  
- Urine albumin-creatinine ratio measures only albumin, not helpful for identifying nonalbumin proteins.  

Potential Serious Clinical Pitfalls:  
- Failure to investigate significant proteinuria may lead to missed diagnosis of serious conditions like multiple myeloma.  
- Relying solely on urine dipstick can underestimate nonalbumin proteinuria.  
- Not performing urine protein electrophoresis could delay appropriate treatment.





{Rhabdomyolysis and Hyperphosphatemia}  
- Hyperphosphatemia often due to chronic kidney disease (CKD) or acute kidney injury (AKI).  
- Rhabdomyolysis & tumor lysis syndrome cause acute serum phosphate elevation due to cellular damage.  

- Atorvastatin-induced rhabdomyolysis (risk <0.1%) can lead to hyperphosphatemia; evidenced by elevated creatine kinase (CK).  
- Phosphate is primarily intracellular; widespread cellular damage increases serum phosphate, especially with decreased GFR.  
- Insulin deficiency can lead to hyperphosphatemia but often results in hypophosphatemia due to hyperphosphaturia from osmotic diuresis.  
- Vitamin D toxicity causes hyperphosphatemia with elevated calcium levels, which are absent in this patient.  

**Potential Serious Clinical Pitfalls:**  
- Misattributing hyperphosphatemia solely to CKD with mild dysfunction.  
- Overlooking statin-induced myopathy as a cause of elevated CK and phosphate levels.  
- Failing to recognize that phosphate-containing cathartics can cause acute elevations, especially with reduced GFR.





{Renal Vein Thrombosis (RVT)}  
- RVT is a complication of nephrotic syndrome, most commonly with membranous nephropathy (MN).  
- Preferred imaging for suspected RVT in acute kidney injury (AKI) or GFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m² is renal ultrasonography with Doppler.  

- Gold standard for RVT diagnosis is selective renal venography, but less invasive tests are preferred.  
- Anti–phospholipase receptor A2 antibodies are found in ~70% of MN patients; not useful for AKI diagnosis.  
- FENa <1% indicates prerenal AKI; however, can be elevated in other conditions. FENa >2% suggests acute tubular necrosis.  
- RVT may be asymptomatic; hematuria & flank pain are common but not definitive.  

**Potential serious clinical pitfalls:**  
- Relying solely on FENa can mislead diagnosis due to overlapping conditions.  
- Avoid contrast exposure in AKI patients when considering renal venography.  
- Asymptomatic RVT may be overlooked despite high suspicion.





Manage hemodialysis line–related sepsis  
- Tunneled catheters should be removed immediately for severe sepsis, metastatic infection, exit-site/tunnel infection, persistent fever, or bacteremia despite antibiotics.  
- Antibiotic lock therapy (vancomycin &/or ceftazidime) is an alternative for stable patients with less virulent organisms (e.g., Staphylococcus epidermitis).  

Additional clinically relevant info:  
- Infection = 2nd leading cause of death in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients.  
- Patients with ESKD are at increased risk due to chronic inflammation & frequent healthcare exposure.  
- Tunneled catheters increase bacteremia risk; empiric antibiotics should be given while awaiting blood cultures.  
- AVF excision is not indicated; AVFs have the lowest infection risk compared to grafts & catheters.  
- Catheter exchange over a guidewire may be considered for stable patients without tunnel infection or if bacteremia clears within 48 hours.  

Potential serious clinical pitfalls:  
- Attempting catheter salvage in severe sepsis or with Staphylococcus aureus infections can worsen outcomes.  
- Mismanagement of tunneled catheters can lead to increased morbidity & mortality in vulnerable patients.  
- Delaying catheter removal in the presence of severe infection increases the risk of complications.





{Gitelman Syndrome}  
- Patients typically present in late adolescence or early adulthood.  
- Characterized by low-normal blood pressure, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, hypomagnesemia, & high-normal serum calcium levels.  

    |      |-- Surreptitious Vomiting
    |      |      |-- Similar features to Gitelman Syndrome
    |      |      |-- Low urine chloride
    |      |      |-- Urine calcium excretion not low


- Autosomal recessive disorder affecting sodium chloride transporter in distal tubule.  
- Low urine calcium excretion is common; urine diuretic screen is negative.  
- Differential diagnosis includes Bartter syndrome, laxative abuse, & primary hyperaldosteronism.  
- Bartter syndrome presents in early childhood, has normal/increased urine calcium, & is less common.  
- Primary hyperaldosteronism typically presents with hypertension; low blood pressure excludes this diagnosis.  

**Potential Serious Clinical Pitfalls:**  
- Misdiagnosing Gitelman syndrome as laxative abuse due to metabolic alkalosis.  
- Confusing with primary hyperaldosteronism despite low blood pressure.  
- Overlooking urine chloride levels in cases of surreptitious vomiting.





Prevent cardiovascular events in a patient with chronic kidney disease.  
- Statins reduce cardiovascular events in CKD but do not slow CKD progression.  
- High-intensity atorvastatin is the preferred treatment for ASCVD risk reduction in CKD patients.  

- ACC/AHA recommends moderate-intensity statin for patients aged 40-75 years with diabetes; high-intensity if risk modifiers present (e.g., albuminuria ≥30 mcg/mg creatinine or eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m²).  
- ADA endorses high-intensity statin therapy for diabetes patients with ASCVD risk factors.  
- KDIGO recommends statin therapy for all patients >40 years with non-dialysis CKD.  
- Atorvastatin is favored due to hepatic clearance & no renal dose adjustments; may reduce proteinuria.  

**Potential serious clinical pitfalls:**  
- Evolocumab & ezetimibe not indicated for this patient.  
- Moderate-intensity rosuvastatin insufficient & may increase kidney injury risk in severe CKD.





{Hepatitis C Virus Infection and Membranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis}  
- Immune complex MPGN is linked to infectious, autoimmune, or malignancy-associated causes.  
- HCV infection is the most common infectious cause of immune complex MPGN.  

- Risk factors for HCV include transactional sex & IV drug use.  
- Kidney biopsy shows immune complex deposition (IgG, IgM, IgA + C1q/C3) on immunofluorescence.  
- Treatment involves anti-HCV antiviral therapy & potential immunosuppression (glucocorticoids + rituximab).  
- C3 glomerulopathies (rare) show isolated C3 staining, indicating alternative complement pathway activation.  

- Potential clinical pitfalls: Misdiagnosing HCV-related MPGN as C3 glomerulopathy could lead to unnecessary genetic testing.





{Symptomatic Hyponatremia Treatment}  
- Initial treatment: acutely increase serum sodium by 3-4 mEq/L (3-4 mmol/L) with 3% saline infusion.  
- Simultaneous desmopressin + 3% saline = more predictable & safer increase in serum sodium.  

- Determine if hyponatremia is acute (<48 hrs) or chronic (>48 hrs); treat chronic if duration unknown.  
- Rapid correction >8 mEq/L (8 mmol/L) in 24 hrs = increased risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS).  
- Monitor serum sodium every 2 hrs during treatment; administer either 100-mL bolus or 30 mL/h of 3% saline.  
- Fluid restriction alone is inadequate for symptomatic patients; aim to improve symptoms & prevent complications.  
- 0.9% saline may worsen hyponatremia in SIADH due to water retention.  
- Tolvaptan is contraindicated in symptomatic hyponatremia due to unpredictable response.  

**Potential Serious Clinical Pitfalls:**  
- Overly rapid correction of serum sodium can lead to ODS.  
- Failure to recognize chronic hyponatremia can result in inadequate treatment.  
- Inappropriate use of fluid restriction or 0.9% saline can worsen the condition.





{Screening for Albuminuria in Hypertension Management}  
- Direct quantification of albuminuria is essential in high-risk patients; dipstick urinalysis may miss moderately increased albuminuria.  
- First-line treatment for hypertension in diabetes patients with urine albumin-creatinine ratio >300 mg/g is an ACE inhibitor or ARB at max tolerated dose.  ***

- ACC/AHA BP guideline: BP goal <130/80 mm Hg for diabetes patients.  
- ADA recommends BP target <130/80 mm Hg for diabetes & hypertension with high cardiovascular risk (ASCVD ≥15%); target 140/90 mm Hg if ASCVD <15%.  
- ACE inhibitors/ARBs indicated for patients with hypertension, diabetes, & urine albumin-creatinine ratio ≥30 mg/g; >300 mg/g is a clear indication for treatment.  

- Serious clinical pitfalls:  
  - Relying solely on dipstick urinalysis can lead to mismanagement.  
  - Inadequate follow-up timing; BP should be remeasured in 1 month, not 3 months.  
  - Nonpharmacologic therapy alone is insufficient for stage 2 hypertension management.





{Diagnosing Alcoholic Ketoacidosis}  
- Alcoholic ketoacidosis = increased anion gap metabolic acidosis & minimal ketones on urine dipstick.  

- Ethanol metabolism -> NADH ↑, leads to ketone production (acetoacetate & β-hydroxybutyrate).  
- Nitroprusside reagent detects acetoacetate only -> urine tests may be falsely negative.  
- Direct measurement of β-hydroxybutyrate levels may be necessary for definitive diagnosis.  

- Ethylene glycol & methanol toxicities = plasma osmolal gap >10 mOsm/kg H2O; this patient = gap of 3 mOsm/kg H2O.  
- Isopropyl alcohol metabolized to acetone -> ketosis but not acidosis; no osmolal gap present in this case.  

- Clinical pitfalls:  
  - Low or absent serum ethanol levels may occur by time of evaluation.  
  - Misdiagnosis due to false-negative urine ketone tests.  
  - Overlooking other toxicities (ethylene glycol, methanol) without osmolal gap.





{Management of Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease with Non-Dialytic Palliative Therapy}  
- Goal of non-dialytic palliative therapy: prolong comfort & functioning in ESKD patients.  ***
- Intensify hypertension management is the most appropriate intervention for this patient.  

- Older patients with ESKD & comorbidities may gain minimal lifespan from aggressive treatments.  
- Non-dialytic medical therapy avoids dialysis burdens & reduces hospitalizations vs. hemodialysis in older patients.  
- Blood pressure target: <140 mm Hg for older patients with a history of stroke.  ***
- Serum phosphorus levels should be normal before considering phosphate binders.  
- Hospice care may be indicated later as chronic kidney disease progresses.  

Potential Serious Clinical Pitfalls:  
- Discontinuing all medications other than insulin contradicts non-dialytic medical management philosophy.  
- Failing to manage hypertension effectively can lead to complications in patients with a stroke history.  
- Misjudging the patient's need for hospice care may delay appropriate end-of-life support.





{Urothelial Cancer Screening in Patients with Hematuria and Aristolochic Acid Nephropathy}  
- Herbal medications containing aristolochic acid can lead to nephropathy & increase urothelial cancer risk.  
- CT urography & cystoscopy with retrograde pyelography are key tests for hematuria & urothelial cancer risk.  

- Chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis (CTIN) is linked to prolonged use of herbal medications, especially from China.  
- Young patients without risk factors may only need observation after ruling out stones, renal masses, & infections for a single hematuria episode.  
- MRI is not the gold standard for lower urinary tract evaluation; CT is preferred for renal masses.  
- Renal angiography is a last resort for unexplained persistent gross hematuria.  

Potential Serious Clinical Pitfalls:  
- Failing to consider herbal medication use in patients with CTIN may overlook urothelial cancer risk.  
- Misinterpreting imaging results could lead to unnecessary procedures or missed diagnoses.  
- Not recognizing the significance of hematuria in young patients with a history of herbal medication use may delay proper management.





{infection-related glomerulonephritis}  
- Treatment is primarily supportive & targets the infectious cause.  
- Nafcillin is the most appropriate treatment for IRGN.  

- Diabetes mellitus is the most common comorbidity; older age (>65 years) is a key risk factor.  
- Prognosis is excellent in children; adults with Staphylococcus aureus & gram-negative IRGN have less favorable outcomes.  
- ACE inhibitors (e.g., lisinopril) are not recommended during acute kidney injury but can be considered for proteinuric CKD later.  
- Glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone) are rarely indicated unless severe proliferative glomerulonephritis is present.  
- Diuretics & sodium restriction are indicated only with hypertension & edema; not applicable in this patient.  

Potential serious clinical pitfalls:  
- Initiating ACE inhibitors during acute kidney injury can worsen function.  
- Overlooking the need for supportive care targeting the infectious etiology may lead to poor outcomes.  
- Misdiagnosing severity of glomerular lesions can lead to inappropriate treatment decisions.





Preeclampsia is defined as new-onset hypertension with proteinuria (≥300 mg/24 h or a urine protein-creatinine ratio ≥300 mg/g) after 20 weeks of pregnancy.
Preeclampsia can be diagnosed in pregnant patients without proteinuria if hypertension is accompanied by evidence of other end-organ damage (thrombocytopenia, kidney dysfunction, liver dysfunction, pulmonary edema, cerebral or visual symptoms).





{Evaluation of Kidney Function with Serum Cystatin C}  
- Serum cystatin C is more sensitive for detecting mild kidney function decrements vs. serum creatinine.  
- Serum creatinine levels can be misleading due to variations in muscle mass, especially in older adults.  

- Increased muscle mass -> elevated serum creatinine; decreased muscle mass -> lower creatinine without GFR change.  
- Serum cystatin C is less influenced by age, sex, muscle mass, & body weight; provides a reliable GFR index.  
- Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is an unreliable kidney function marker due to variable production & reabsorption.  
- Creatinine clearance via 24-hour urine collection can overestimate GFR & is prone to collection errors.  
- Radionuclide imaging is the gold standard for GFR measurement but is unnecessary if serum cystatin C is available.  

**Potential Serious Clinical Pitfalls:**  
- Misinterpretation of serum creatinine due to muscle mass variations can lead to inappropriate clinical decisions.  
- Reliance on BUN can result in underestimating or misjudging kidney function.  
- Errors in 24-hour urine collection can compromise GFR estimation.





Renal AL Amyloidosis  
- Gold standard for diagnosis = apple-green birefringence with Congo red stain under polarized light.  
- Most common form = AL amyloidosis (60%-65% of cases) derived from monoclonal immunoglobulin light chains.  

Additional Clinically Relevant Info:  
- Kidney involvement common in systemic amyloidosis.  
- Typical presentation = nephrotic-range proteinuria + renal insufficiency; nephrotic syndrome in 25%-50% of patients.  
- AL amyloidosis typically affects patients >50 years old, predominantly men.  
- Serum/urine protein electrophoresis + immunofixation identify monoclonal protein; serum free light chain quantification is more sensitive.  
- All three testing modalities usually checked simultaneously.  

Potential Serious Clinical Pitfalls:  
- Diabetic kidney disease typically >10 years of type 2 diabetes; absence of microvascular/macrovascular complications suggests need for biopsy.  
- IgA nephropathy usually in youth/early adulthood; older patients with nephrotic syndrome unlikely to have IgAN.  
- Membranous nephropathy has preserved kidney function; diagnosis may be missed if relying solely on biopsy without serologic testing.





{Minimal Change Glomerulopathy with Acute Kidney Injury}  
- Classic presentation: sudden-onset nephrotic syndrome -> abrupt edema & anasarca.  
- Up to 25% of adults with minimal change glomerulopathy (MCG) may have acute kidney injury (AKI).  

**Additional Clinically Relevant Information:**  
- MCG accounts for 10%-15% of nephrotic syndrome cases in adults, especially in older patients (≥65 years).  
- Risk factors for AKI in MCG: older age, hypertension, low serum albumin, heavy proteinuria.  
- Urinalysis findings in this patient are typical of nephrotic syndrome, not glomerulonephritis (e.g., ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis shows hematuria & subnephrotic proteinuria).  
- Membranous nephropathy usually causes AKI via renal vein thrombosis; Doppler ultrasound did not show this in the patient.  
- Edema onset in membranous nephropathy is slower than in MCG.  

**Potential Serious Clinical Pitfalls:**  
- Misdiagnosing MCG as ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis or anti–glomerular basement membrane disease due to AKI presentation.  
- Overlooking renal vein thrombosis in membranous nephropathy when evaluating AKI.  
- Failing to recognize the risk of AKI in older patients with MCG, leading to delayed management.





Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) Treatment with Tolvaptan  
- Tolvaptan slows kidney function decline in adults at risk for progressive ADPKD.  
- FDA approved in 2018 for adults with specific risk factors for end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).  

Additional Clinically Relevant Information:  
- 4 risk factors for ESKD:  
  1. Hypertension onset <35 years  
  2. Urologic events <35 years (e.g., gross hematuria, cyst infection)  
  3. eGFR decrease >5 mL/min/1.73 m² in 1 year  
  4. Family history of ESKD at or before 58 years  
- Other risk factors: male sex, total kidney volume > expected for age, truncating PKD1 variant.  
- Renin-aldosterone system blockade is a staple treatment; ACE inhibitors are effective.  
- Total kidney volume measurement is important but not necessary for high-risk patients; can start tolvaptan directly.  
- Octreotide reduces cyst fluid but does not slow kidney function decline like tolvaptan.  

Potential Serious Clinical Pitfalls:  
- Switching from ACE inhibitor to angiotensin receptor blocker (e.g., telmisartan) may not benefit patient already at goal blood pressure.  
- Failure to recognize high-risk patients may delay appropriate tolvaptan therapy.  
- Misunderstanding the role of total kidney volume in risk assessment could lead to unnecessary imaging.





{Primary Hyperaldosteronism as a Cause of Secondary Hypertension}  
- Most common cause of secondary hypertension.  
- Suspect in resistant hypertension, hypokalemia, family history of early-onset hypertension, BP >160/100 mm Hg, or stroke <40 years.  

- Screening test: plasma aldosterone concentration/plasma renin activity ratio.  
- Triad: resistant hypertension, metabolic alkalosis, hypokalemia common.  ***
- Normal serum potassium levels may occur; high suspicion needed.  
- Substantial hypokalemia (serum K+ 2.9 mEq/L) with low-dose thiazide use is significant.  

- Pheochromocytoma less likely due to absence of palpitations, headaches, tachycardia.  
- Renovascular disease unlikely without abdominal bruits or atherosclerosis signs.  
- Hypercortisolism (Cushing syndrome) rare compared to primary hyperaldosteronism; absence of Cushingoid features makes it unlikely.  

- Clinical pitfalls:  
  - Normal serum potassium may mask diagnosis.  
  - Overlooking primary hyperaldosteronism in patients with resistant hypertension.  
  - Misdiagnosing conditions (pheochromocytoma, renovascular disease, Cushing syndrome) without adequate suspicion.





{Management of Edema in Nephrotic Syndrome}  
- Add metolazone (thiazide diuretic) to loop diuretics for refractory edema.  
- Continuous IV infusion of loop diuretics has less ototoxicity vs. bolus injections, but no clear superiority in diuretic efficacy.  
- Glucocorticoid therapy (prednisone) for FSGS should continue for at least 12-16 weeks before considering second-line therapy (cyclosporine).  

- Factors for IV diuretics admission: lack of response to thiazide/potassium-sparing diuretics, acute respiratory symptoms from pulmonary edema, significant ascites.  
- Hemodialysis with ultrafiltration is for anasarca, significant kidney dysfunction, & inability to diurese on maximal IV diuretics.  
- Nephrotic-range proteinuria & hypoalbuminemia do not justify stopping prednisone after only 3 weeks of treatment.  

**Potential Serious Clinical Pitfalls:**  
- Prematurely considering glucocorticoid therapy refractory before 12-16 weeks.  
- Not recognizing when to escalate to IV diuretics or hemodialysis.  
- Mismanagement of diuretics can lead to electrolyte imbalances.





{Crystal-induced acute kidney injury from intravenous acyclovir}  
- IV acyclovir can cause acute kidney injury (AKI) due to intratubular obstruction from crystal precipitation.  
- Correction of volume depletion is critical for prevention & treatment of crystal-induced AKI.  

- Urinary findings: hematuria, pyuria, crystals.  
- High-dose acyclovir therapy requires aggressive volume expansion, especially in patients with chronic kidney disease & volume depletion.  
- Acute glomerulonephritis (Option A) is unlikely in this case due to hereditary nephritis not causing acute changes.  
- Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) typically takes 7-10 days to develop; classic presentation occurs in only 10%-30% of cases.  
- Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is suggested by pigmented brown casts, which are not present in this patient's urinalysis.  

**Potential serious clinical pitfalls:**  
- Failure to correct volume depletion can lead to severe AKI.  
- Discontinuation of acyclovir may be necessary if AKI develops.  
- Misdiagnosing AKI as AIN or ATN without considering crystal-induced obstruction can delay appropriate management.





{Mycophenolate Mofetil and Pregnancy}  
- Mycophenolate mofetil is teratogenic & contraindicated in pregnancy.  
- Discontinue mycophenolate mofetil before conception; ensure stable disease for 3-6 months before pregnancy.  

- Risks of mycophenolate mofetil: first-trimester pregnancy loss, fetal malformations (distal limbs, heart, esophagus, kidneys, cleft lip/palate).  
- Hydroxychloroquine is safe in pregnancy; reduces disease flares & improves outcomes in SLE.  
- Glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone) can be continued if benefits > risks; monitor for adverse effects.  
- Azathioprine is a safer alternative for immunosuppression during pregnancy.  

- Potential serious clinical pitfalls:  
  - Continuing mycophenolate mofetil during pregnancy can lead to severe fetal complications.  
  - Failure to achieve disease stability before conception may result in adverse pregnancy outcomes.  
  - Inadequate monitoring of glucocorticoid therapy may exacerbate preexisting conditions during pregnancy.





{Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in diabetic kidney disease}  
- SGLT2 inhibitors slow CKD progression & reduce death risk from kidney/cardiovascular complications.  
- Canagliflozin is the most appropriate treatment for patients with diabetic kidney disease & stage G3 CKD with nephrotic-range proteinuria.  

- GLP-1 receptor agonists (e.g., liraglutide) may reduce cardiovascular event risk & slow CKD progression.  
- Proven interventions for CKD: glycemic control, blood pressure control, RAS blockers, finerenone, avoidance of renal toxins.  
- Dual blockade of RAS (ACE inhibitor + ARB) is contraindicated due to increased adverse events without added kidney benefit.  

- Glyburide carries hypoglycemia risk in CKD; thiazolidinediones (e.g., pioglitazone) may cause fluid retention.  
- Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (e.g., sitagliptin) have a neutral effect on CKD progression.  

Potential serious clinical pitfalls:  
- Avoid dual blockade with ACE inhibitors & ARBs.  
- Monitor for hypoglycemia with sulfonylureas in CKD.  
- Be cautious with thiazolidinediones due to fluid retention risks.
