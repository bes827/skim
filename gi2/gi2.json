Any form of lifestyle weight loss interventions including diet, exercise, or a combination of both, can have beneficial impacts on participants with prediabetes. Protocol registration PROSPERO (CRD42023465322).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTotal energy expenditure measured using doubly labeled water in adults with major chronic diseases: A systematic review.\r\n Energy requirements vary across chronic diseases, although there is insufficient evidence to suggest that TEE is different than controls. Further research is needed to inform energy requirement recommendations that consider chronic disease.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Meta-analysis of the Therapeutic Impact of Cannabinoids in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\nThis meta-analysis of clinical trials suggests that cannabinoids are associated with improved quality of life in both CD and UC, as well as improved disease activity but not inflammation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSystematic Review: Practices and Programs in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Transition Care.\r\nTransition- and medical-related outcomes for adolescents with IBD have been shown to benefit from structured transition programs but practices vary greatly between centers. There is no current standardized transition model for patients with IBD prompting further research to guide future development of guidelines and models of care.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Advancing nutrition knowledge, skills, and attitudes in medical education and training: key themes and recommendations from the 2023 Summit. \r\nHowever, a deficiency in nutrition education persists in medical education, rendering physicians ill-prepared to address the vital role of nutrition in health and disease. This article summarizes the key themes and recommendations generated during the Summit on Medical Education in Nutrition, hosted in March 2023 by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education in collaboration with American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine and Association of American Medical Colleges.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAssociations between dietary one-carbon metabolism nutrients, genetic risk, with Alzheimer's disease: a prospective cohort study.\r\nIn this prospective cohort study, we found that higher intake of OCM nutrients is associated with a reduced risk of AD. Participants with a high genetic risk of AD are more likely to benefit from dietary OCM nutrients intake.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClinical and biochemical responses to treatment of uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition: a multicenter observational cohort from the OptiDiag study. \r\nChildren with combined deficits had higher rates of iron deficiency and wasting while those with low WHZ alone and combined deficits had higher rates of tachypnea and pneumonia during treatment. Given the comparable treatment responses of children with low WHZ alone and those with low MUAC alone, and the greater vulnerability at admission and during treatment in those with combined deficits, our findings support retaining WHZ as an independent diagnostic and admission criterion of SAM, alongside MUAC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEffect of spirulina on risk of hospitalization among patients with COVID-19: the TOGETHER randomized trial. \r\nSpirulina has no any clinical benefits as an outpatient therapy for COVID-19 compared with placebo with respect to reducing the retention in an emergency setting or COVID-19-related hospitalization. There are no differences between spirulina and placebo for other secondary outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFlavonoid intakes, COPD, adult asthma, and lung function: a cohort study in the UK Biobank.\r\nModerate to high flavonoid intakes were associated with a lower risk of COPD and better lung function, particularly among ever smokers.
