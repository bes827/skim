These thresholds have been used in the development of the 2024 British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of IBD but can and should also be used by study designers and, most importantly, by clinicians when discussing evidence with patients as part of shared decision making. Future work to validate these findings globally and with other groups, including patients, is needed.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeta-analysis\r\nmeta-analyses and systematic reviews\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Industry study sponsorship and conflicts of interest on the effect of unprocessed red meat on cardiovascular disease risk: a systematic review of clinical trials.\r\nOur findings highlight that using animal protein as a comparator in industry-funded studies, with quality of evidence rated as very low to low, may underestimate the cardiovascular benefits of reducing red meat intake. Most studies without conflicts of interest with the red meat industry suggested an unfavorable effect of unprocessed red meat consumption on risk factors for cardiovascular disease.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    Chronic pancreatitis and extra pancreatic cancers- A systematic review and meta analysis.\r\n Patients with CP have an increased risk of developing EP cancers compared to patients without CP, in particular lung and liver cancer which had the highest relative risk. Shared risk factor modifications, such as smoking cessation and alcohol reduction, could lower the risk of common EP cancers. Further, implementing non-invasive screening measures may aid in early diagnosis in this high-risk group.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMinimally invasive versus open distal pancreatectomy for pancreatic Tumors: An updated meta-analysis and meta-regression.\r\nMIDP offers superior outcomes in procedure efficacy, surgical and postoperative outcomes compared to ODP. These findings highlight MIDP as a safe and effective alternative for pancreatic surgery, supported by robust subgroup and sensitivity analyses.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    A Novel Nutritional Assessment Tool Combining the mNUTRIC Score and the GLIM Criteria with Prognostic Value for In-Hospital Mortality in Critically Ill Patients : A Single-Center Retrospective Cohort Study.\r\nThis novel nutritional assessment tool had strong prognostic value in being associated with in-hospital mortality. Prospective validation with an external dataset is warranted. A comprehensive nutritional assessment of the current status and future risk at ICU admission could be the most critical factor in assessing the prognosis of critically ill patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAssociation of sociodemographic factors and a healthy and sustainable dietary pattern in adult population in Mexico, United States and Canada: a cross-sectional study.\r\n Mexico, the US, and Canada have an unhealthy and high environmental impact dietary pattern. The groups with lower compliance are men, younger individuals, and those with lower educational attainment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDietary patterns, serum metabolites and risk of cardiovascular disease in US Hispanic/Latino adults: a prospective analysis of the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL).\r\nHealthier diet patterns and related serum metabolite profile were associated with lower risk of CVD in US Hispanic/Latino adults.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEffect of age and sex on the urinary elimination of a single dose of mixed flavonoids: results from a single-arm intervention in healthy UK adults.\r\n Total elimination recovery of (poly)phenols was relatively consistent across age and sex groups, while elimination kinetics differed substantially;  possibly resulting from differences in intestinal transit time or kidney clearance. Assuming (poly)phenol metabolites have varying biological activities, establishing dose response relationships, and defining metabolite profiles in population subgroups is required to inform the future development of dietary flavonoid/(poly)phenol recommendations. Clinical trial registry NCT01922869.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Biological Ageing and the Risk of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Exploring the Role of Lifestyle and Genetic Susceptibility in a Nationwide Prospective Study.\r\nPhenoAge acceleration may serve as a useful biomarker for identifying high-risk individuals, offering potential for integration into targeted prevention strategies and personalized treatment approaches for IBD.This study explores how accelerated biological aging (PhenoAge acceleration) and genetic susceptibility influence the risk of inflammatory bowel disease. Findings indicate that higher PhenoAge acceleration and genetic risk scores significantly increase the likelihood of developing ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDecreased Fecal Nicotinamide and Increased Bacterial Nicotinamidase Gene Expression in Ulcerative Colitis Patients.\r\nThese findings suggest that gut microbiota dysbiosis contributes to reduced vitamin B3 metabolism in UC patients. The study highlights the potential of replenishing vitamin B3 metabolic pathways as a novel therapeutic approach for UC treatment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSPH3127 (Sitokiren), a Novel Renin Inhibitor, Suppresses Colitis Development in Mouse Models of Experimental Colitis.\r\nThese results demonstrate that SPH3127 is able to effectively block colitis development in mouse experimental colitis models. Its anti-colitogenic activity is achieved at least in part by suppressing mucosal TH1 and TH17 activation while promoting IL-10 production from mucosal CD25+ T cells, thus forming an anti-inflammatory environment in the colonic mucosa.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSix-Year Observation Data Reveal Reduction in Concomitant Steroid Overuse for Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Germany.\r\nThis study provides real-world insights into the patterns of OCS use and overuse in IBD patients. The continued reliance on OCS is highlighted, particularly in CD patients and younger age groups. Notably, steroid overuse has decreased significantly over the last 6 years.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTherapeutic Potential and Translational Challenges for Bacterial Extracellular Vesicles in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\nIn this review, we summarize the work done to date establishing the potential of BEVs to provide the therapeutic benefits in IBD and discuss the hurdles BEVs must overcome to achieve clinical translation. We also consider future directions for BEV therapeutics, especially treatment potential for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), which shares similarities in pathophysiology with IBD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nUnravelling the Relationship Between Obesity and Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\nObesity has been demonstrated to be associated with an attenuated response to immunomodulators and biological agents, as well as higher rates of peri-operative surgical complications. A better understanding of the relationship between obesity and IBD can be applied to clinical decision-making in personalizing treatment plans, promoting weight loss in patients with obesity, and identifying areas of future research.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nUsefulness of Prostaglandin E-Major Urinary Metabolite in Monitoring Crohn's Disease Activity: A Prospective Cross-Sectional Study.\r\nPGE-MUM is a biomarker that can reflect endoscopic activity in patients with CD and may be particularly useful in small intestinal lesions.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Deucravacitinib in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: 12-Week Efficacy and Safety Results From Three Randomized Phase 2 Studies in Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis.\r\nDeucravacitinib at multiple doses did not demonstrate significant clinical benefit vs placebo in moderately to severely active Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Deucravacitinib was safe and well-tolerated.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDistinct perturbances in metabolic pathways associate with disease progression in inflammatory bowel disease.\r\nSpecific metabolites and pathways are associated with disease progression in IBD, highlighting potential prognostic biomarkers and relevant pathways.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRestoring Prostacyclin/PGI2-PTGIR Signaling Alleviates Intestinal Fibrosis in Crohn's Disease via Fibroblast-specific YAP/TAZ Inhibition.\r\nThe antifibrotic effects of PGI2-PTGIR signaling are impaired in CD. Restoring PGI2-PTGIR signaling is a pharmacologically tractable and cell-selective approach to targeting YAP/TAZ via PTGIR, which reverses intestinal fibrosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRisk of colectomy is decreasing among newly diagnosed Finnish ulcerative colitis patients.\r\nThe risk of colectomy in UC patients has decreased in the 21st century.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSerum Biomarkers of Collagen Remodeling are Associated with Intestinal Fibrosis and Differentiates Stenotic from Luminal Crohn's Disease Patients: A Pre- and Post-Resection Longitudinal Study.\r\n Collagen markers distinguished stenosing from luminal CD, and they correlated to histological fibrosis and chronic inflammation promising for understanding ECM remodeling. This study highlights the need for extended follow-up to assess long-term stenosis-related outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe angiotensin receptor blocker, losartan, reduces inflammation and fibrosis, and prevents relapse of fibrosis after steroid-induced remission, in mice prone to Crohn's disease-like ileitis.\r\nLosartan, and other drugs targeting the renin-angiotensin system, may serve as an effective treatment to successfully dampen intestinal fibrosis during active inflammation, as well as prevent its progression after corticosteroid-induced remission in Crohn's patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    From embedded interprofessional clinics to expanded alcohol-associated liver disease programs.\r\nDrawing from analogous patient populations served by collaborative models in primary care and comprehensive eating disorder treatment, the expanded ALD care framework proposes practical strategies toward specific innovations: equipoise between biomedical and psychosocial care elements, increased clinician number and reach, long term patient relationships, harm reduction and palliative care, outreach to external agencies and clinicians, and enhanced support for patients and families. The article also defines attributes of innovative healthcare systems which support expanded ALD care.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOccult multifocal and incidental hepatocellular carcinoma: An analysis of long-term survival and risk factors at a single liver transplant center.\r\n In patients with known HCC prior to LT, presence of omHCC is common and associated with inferior post-LT survival and higher recurrence rates. The development of improved radiographic and serum biomarkers which more accurately reflect explant tumor burden may improve patient selection and post-LT outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSocial Determinants of Health are Associated with Liver Transplant Evaluation and Listing in a Safety-Net Referral Cohort.\r\nA sensitivity analysis including an existing multicenter cohort re-demonstrated the significance of residence, adequacy of social support, and MELD score in probability of listing. Social determinants of health were key to successful evaluation and listing for LT among referred SNH patients and provide targets for intervention.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreas\r\n    Pancreatic Fat Infiltration: A Key Marker in The Metabolic Continuum.\r\nPFI is a relevant metabolic marker associated with central obesity, insulin resistance, and increased pancreatic stiffness. These findings support the potential of transabdominal 2D-SWE as a non-invasive tool for detecting early pancreatic structural, particularly in patients with T2D. Longitudinal studies are warranted to clarify its role in predicting pancreatic dysfunction and metabolic disease progression.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPerioperative Pain Management for Complex Pancreatic Resections for Patients with Chronic Pancreatitis.\r\nKetamine provided similar opioid sparing analgesia compared to opioid epidurals. Ketamine is a promising adjunctive analgesic in patients with chronic pancreatitis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPrognostic Significance of ABO Blood Type in Patients with Advanced Pancreatic Cancer Treated with Nab-Paclitaxel Plus Gemcitabine.\r\nPatients with the B blood type had a markedly poorer prognosis and a higher prevalence of sarcopenia. Patients who have APC with the B blood type may require additional supportive treatment for sarcopenia.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nProtein N-Glycosylation Traits Combined with CA19-9 Accurately Distinguish Pancreatic Cancer Cases From Healthy Controls and Benign Pancreatic Diseases. \r\nBoth plasma NGTs and CA19-9 distinguish PDAC from a diverse-control cohort. The accuracy further improves when these readouts are combined, showing promise for future early detection methods.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRisk of Myocardial Infarction and Stroke after a First Episode of Acute Pancreatitis: A Self-Controlled Case Series Study. \r\nThe IRR for stroke during the risk interval was 2.12 (95% CI, 1.74-2.58), peaking in the first 10 days (IRR, 3.40;  95% CI, 2.33-4.96) and gradually declining. Our study reveals a temporary increase in the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke after hospitalization for a first episode of acute pancreatitis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSurgical Resection of Murine PDAC Alters Hepatic Metastases and Immune Microenvironment. \r\nCollectively, we describe a preclinical resection model that offers a means to investigate MRD. Using this model, we delineated effects of surgical resection on metastatic outgrowth and uncovered a protective link between the postoperative hepatic eosinophilia and further metastatic progression.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    Comparison of thrombosis risk in patients undergoing purified and non-purified islet cell transplantation.\r\nWhile PVT is a relatively rare event in both purified and non-purified IAT when peri-operative and post-operative full-dose heparinization is administered, there remains a clinical difference in PVT formation between purified and non-purified IATs. Although bleeding risk may potentially be mitigated by a reduction in the duration of full dose heparinization without a corresponding risk in PVT rate, further investigation is warranted.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatic adenocarcinoma patients with pain have abnormal central pain processing.\r\nP-QST revealed abnormal central pain processing in PDAC patients compared to healthy controls, which may have implications for pain management.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSuboptimal adherence to surveillance in high-risk individuals for pancreatic cancer at a tertiary care academic center: Lessons from real-world surveillance patterns.\r\nIt is difficult to achieve high adherence rates for annual pancreatic cancer screening of HRIs as recommended by the latest guidelines. Age and screening modality may be factors that contribute to adherence difficulty.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe impact of delayed graft function after pancreas transplantation on clinical outcomes and survival.\r\nOf note, in the multivariable analysis pDGF showed a strong trend towards worse graft survival without reaching statistical significance (HR:2.33, 95 % CI: 0.95-5.82;  p = 0.069) CONCLUSION: pDGF represents a common condition, depending both from donor and recipient conditions. Its clinical impact concerns the early postoperative stay and the long-term graft survival as well.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Three Decades of the Mediterranean Diet Pyramid: A Narrative Review of Its History, Evolution, and Advances.\r\nThe development of the MedDiet pyramid 30 years ago inspired the creation of the Asian, African, and Latin American Heritage Diet Pyramids. Despite robust evidence, further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term effectiveness and adaptability of the MedDiet across diverse populations, cultural settings, and food environments.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous\r\nmisc publications eg case reports, tools of the trade, images of\r\nthe month, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    J Crohns Colitis\r\n    Correction to: Volume 18, Supplement 1.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    \"You're hot then you're cold\": Can we omit recooling after NMP?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLetter to the Editor: Limitations of MRI-serum-based scoring in liver transplant rejection assessment.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOutcomes of kidney after liver transplantation by induction type, Inter-Transplant interval, and immunologic risk: A UNOS analysis.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReply: Limitations of MRI-serum-based scoring in liver transplant rejection assessment.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreas\r\n    Not Dead Yet: Managing the Abdominal Catastrophe in Necrotizing Pancreatitis.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Financial Impact of Drugs Utilized for Medical Management of Chronic Pancreatitisrelated Symptoms.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nUnaddressed Financial Barriers to Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy in Patients with GEPNENs and EPI.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetters&Replies\r\nLetters to the editors and authors’ replies\r\n\r\n\r\n    Pancreatology\r\n    Performance of a novel three-prong asymmetric tip needle in EUS-guided tissue sampling of pancreatic solid Lesions: Implications for diagnosis and molecular profiling.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This work will help in the development of future predictive models to guide thromboprophylaxis in IBD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Adherence to EAT-Lancet diet, biological aging and life expectancy in the UK Biobank: a cohort study.\r\nAdherence to EAT-lancet diet is linked to delayed biological aging and increased life expectancy, regardless of genetic predisposition. This suggests that promoting this sustainable dietary pattern could serve as a practical nutritional strategy for enhancing healthy longevity.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAssessing the adherence and acceptability to iron and folic acid versus multiple micronutrient supplements during pregnancy: A cluster-randomized non-inferiority trial in Cambodia.\r\nBoth IFA and MMS were highly acceptable, yet adherence to MMS was superior to IFA. These findings support the transition from IFA to MMS in Cambodia.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImpact of Dietary Cholesterol from Eggs and Saturated Fat on LDL Cholesterol Levels: A Randomized Cross-Over Study.\r\n Saturated fat, not dietary cholesterol, elevates LDL cholesterol. Compared with consuming a high-saturated fat diet with only one egg per week, consuming two eggs daily as part of a low-saturated fat diet lowers LDL concentrations, which may reduce CVD risk. However, this effect on CVD risk may be mitigated, at least in part, by a reduction in less-atherogenic large LDL-particles and an increase in more atherogenic small LDL-particles. Clinical trial registration\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMaternal prenatal nut and seafood consumption and child neuropsychological function from 4 to 15 years of age: a population-based cohort study.\r\nMaternal diet at pregnancy and omega-3 intake may support long-term cognitive development in children and adolescents.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOne-carbon metabolism, insulin resistance, and fecundability in a Singapore prospective preconception cohort study.\r\nOur findings suggest that higher folate and lower homocysteine levels, which reflected the interlinked folate and methionine cycles, was associated with higher fecundability in preconception women with lower IR, but less so in those with higher IR. Clinical Trial Registry number and website where it was obtained NCT03531658, /study/NCT03531658.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Association of Early Pregnancy Vitamin D and BMI Status with Composite Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes: an Ancillary Analysis of the Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial.\r\nWhile vitamin D supplementation did not reduce APO risk, higher early pregnancy 25(OH)D concentrations were associated with lower odds of APOs in participants with BMI <25 kg/m 2 . These findings highlight the potential importance of higher early pregnancy 25(OH)D concentrations, particularly among those with normal BMI, in reducing APO risk.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe harms of high protein intake: conjectured, postulated, claimed, and presumed, but shown?\r\nIn this perspectives article, we discuss several of the postulated harms cited in academic and lay publications and investigate the strength of evidence to support or refute these asserted harms. We highlight areas of caution relating to experimental design and interpretation of results and propose areas of research that would be helpful to better determine the potential risks associated with high dietary protein intake.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    18F-FAPI PET/CT for Early Detection and Severity Assessment of Intestinal Fibrosis in a Mouse Model.\r\nAs Crohn's disease (CD) with intestinal fibrosis progresses, 18F-FAPI uptake is high in the early stages and then gradually decreases. Activated fibroblasts appear more frequently in the early stages of intestinal fibrosis indicates that 18F-FAPI PET has a great potential for early identification of intestinal fibrosis and provides new insights into treatment decision-making in CD patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCrohn's Disease Stricture Response to Treatment Assessed with Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Intestinal Ultrasound: STRIDENT Randomized Trial.\r\nRadiologic severity of Crohn's disease strictures can improve with drug treatment, with complete stricture resolution observed in some. Intestinal ultrasound and MRI are effective modalities for monitoring the treatment response in patients with stricturing Crohn's disease (STRIDENT Drug Therapy Study  NCT03220841).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDisparities in Access and Treatment for Rural Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Survey of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients and Providers.\r\nThese results demonstrate disparities between rural and urban patients' treatments and access to specialty IBD care. Rural patients and providers are supportive of collaborating with IBD specialists and MDTs. These results can help guide the implementation of innovative IBD care models in the setting of an increasingly complex IBD landscape.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInnate and Adaptive Immunity is not Impacted by Inflammatory Bowel Disease Medications in Pregnant Women and Their Offspring.\r\nThis study provides the foundation for ongoing investigation to more definitively extricate the impact of maternal IBD activity, drug exposures, and disease phenotype on infant immune system development and function. These novel data suggest that IBD pharmacotherapies may not significantly impact maternal or infant immune regulation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMonitoring Structural Bowel Damage in Patients With Crohn's Disease Using Intestinal Ultrasonography: Can It Be Reversed by Biological Treatment?\r\nBiological treatment can reverse SBD in CD, but hospitalizations and surgery rates remain higher in this group.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    Clinical and pathological spectrum of disease severity among patients with acute liver failure (ALF) undergoing deceased donor liver transplantation.\r\n Virtually every patient undergoing liver transplantation for ALF retrospectively appeared to need their transplant, based on expert clinical consensus review. Overall, there was poor correlation between clinical severity and apparent degree of necrosis seen in the 300 liver explants, except perhaps for APAP subjects.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Inflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    AI-Assisted IBD Severity Classification: A Critical Perspective on Current Evidence and Next Steps.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMaternal Microchimerism, a Red Flag or a Red Herring in Very-Early-Onset Inflammatory Bowel Disease?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPast But Not Forgotten: Innate Factors Affect the Course of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Be precise, be reproducible!
