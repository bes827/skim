However, those receiving home infusion were less likely to receive correct weight-based dosing for infliximab and were poorly adherent to routine follow-up.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCrohn's Disease of the Ileoanal Pouch: A High Rate of Potential Overdiagnoses.\r\n Re-evaluation of cross-sectional imaging of the pouch revealed that potential alternative causes were found in nearly half of CDP patients. Cross-sectional imaging is therefore recommended early in the diagnostic pathway to exclude an alternative diagnosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDe Novo Crohn's Disease in Children With Ulcerative Colitis Undergoing Ileal Pouch-Anal Anastomosis: A Multicenter, Retrospective Study From the Pediatric IBD Porto Group of the ESPGHAN.\r\nChildren with UC undergoing IPAA carry a high risk of developing subsequent CD. De novo CD cases showed decreased preoperative body mass index z scores, identifying a poor nutritional status as a possible predictive factor.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDe Novo Crohn's Disease in the Pediatric Pouch.\r\nThe surgically altered environment of the ileal pouch is at risk of a spectrum of ileal pouch disorders, which have limited description in children. In this issue of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases, a multicenter, retrospective study of children with UC who underwent IPAA and developed de novo CD highlights the challenges and opportunities of ileal pouch characterization in children.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFocus on Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors-related Intestinal Inflammation: From Pathogenesis to Therapeutical Approach.\r\nHerein, we performed an insight of the main IRAEs associated with ICIs, focusing on gastroenterological IRAEs and specifically on checkpoint inhibitor colitis, which represents the most widely reported IRAE to date. We comprehensively dissected the current evidence regarding pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of ICIs-induced colitis, touching upon also on innovative therapies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Baseline TREM-1 Whole Blood Gene Expression Does Not Predict Response to Adalimumab Treatment in Patients with Ulcerative Colitis or Crohn's Disease in the SERENE Studies.\r\nBaseline TREM-1 gene expression did not uniformly predict adalimumab response in SERENE clinical trials. Further research is needed to identify potential blood-based biomarkers predictive of response to anti-TNF therapy in patients with IBD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDeep learning models capture histological disease activity in Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis with high fidelity.\r\nDeep learning models based upon GHAS and Geboes scoring systems were effective at distinguishing between the presence and absence of IBD microscopic disease activity.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMaintenance Risankizumab Sustains Induction Response in Patients with Crohn's Disease in a Randomized Phase 3 Trial.\r\nSubcutaneous risankizumab maintenance therapy results in durable improvement in clinical and endoscopic outcomes over 1 year in patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTofacitinib for patients with anti-TNF refractory ulcerative proctitis: a multicenter cohort study from the GETAID.\r\n Tofacitinib may offer a therapeutic option for patients with refractory UP.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nValidation of the pharmacokinetic model for anti- TNFa clearance in infants exposed to anti- TNFa during pregnancy.\r\nThe validity of the anti-TNFa clearance model is high, and hence can be used to guide clinicians regarding timing of live vaccines in infants exposed to adalimumab or infliximab in utero.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    Decreased need for RRT in liver transplant recipients after pretransplant treatment of hepatorenal syndrome-type 1 with terlipressin.\r\nThe post-transplant need for RRT, at 12 months, was significantly lower among those patients who received terlipressin and were alive at Day 365, compared to placebo (p=0.009). Pre-transplant treatment with terlipressin plus albumin in patients with HRS-1 decreased the need for RRT pre- and post-transplant.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe impact of health literacy on adolescent and young adult pediatric liver transplant recipients.\r\nThis study demonstrates that limited HL is associated with decreased measures of TR. Inadequate HL may be an unrecognized barrier to successful HCT. Regular assessment of HL may provide an opportunity for intervention prior to transfer of care. Future studies should investigate the impact of these interventions on long-term medical outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreas\r\n    Factors Associated With Serial Lipase Measurement in Hospitalized Patients With Acute Pancreatitis.\r\n More than one-third of AP patients undergo serial lipase measurements. This practice is more likely to occur on surgical services and in nontertiary hospitals.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGeriatric Nutritional Risk Index Predicts Tolerability of S-1 as Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.\r\nHigh GNRI value is a predictive marker for the completion of S-1 as AC for PDAC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatic Cancer Cells May Adhere to the External Surface of the Puncture Needle After Endoscopic Ultrasound-Guided Fine-Needle Aspiration.\r\n Pancreatic cancer cells may adhere to the puncture needle's external surface after EUS-FNA. Wiping the needle with alcohol swabs after each puncture effectively removes residual cancer cells.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPredictive Value of Antithrombin III and d-Dimer in the Development of Moderate-To-Severe Acute Pancreatitis: A Prospective, Observational Study (AT-PROPANC).\r\n Low AT-III and high d-dimer plasma levels at 24 hours after admission were significantly associated with MSAP/SAP, although their predictive ability was low. C-reactive protein was the best marker tested. Clinical study identifier ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02373293.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRetrospective Evaluation of the Efficacy of Gemcitabine-Based Therapies After FOLFIRINOX Failure in Advanced Pancreatic Cancer, Multi-Center Real-Life Data.\r\n In conclusion, it has been shown that gemcitabine-based second-line treatments contribute to survival in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. In addition, there was no difference in efficacy between gemcitabine monotherapy or combination treatments.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    External validation of scores predicting postoperative fistula after pancreatogastrostomy for pancreatoduodenectomy reconstruction. A single center experience. \r\nWe found that only male gender and soft pancreatic texture are associated with POPF. Specific predictive scores following pancreatogasgtrostomy are needed.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTrends and clinical characteristics of pediatric acute pancreatitis patients in Japan: A comparison with adult cases based on a national administrative inpatient database. \r\nPediatric cases were more frequently transferred from other institutions and treated at academic hospitals than adults (both P < 0.001). There was an upward trend in the proportion of AP among al admissions in pediatrics, with a lower risk of complications and mortality than adult cases.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the publisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Inflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Disease Clearance is not Synonymous with Cure.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIs Ulcerative Colitis Really Ever \"Cleared?\"\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSARS-CoV-2 Serological Response in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    Pancreatic duct pressure: A review of technical aspects and clinical significance.\r\nDuctal hypertension or increased PDP is suspected to be involved in the pathogenesis of pancreatic pain, endocrine and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and recurrent pancreatitis.

Standardizing protocols across studies is recommended, along with designing adequately powered studies aiming a priori to test inter-individual differences . Alternative approaches to the use of COMPx are recommended to allow better characterization of children's energy compensation ability. Registry Registered on PROSPERO  CRD42020197748.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Patient Reported Outcome Measures in Ileoanal Pouch Surgery: a Systematic Review.\r\nOnly half of the papers reviewed used PROMs. The main reported item is bowel function, whilst urogenital, social, and psychological function are the most neglected. There is lack of standardisation for use of PROMs in IPAA. Complexity of UC and of outcomes after IPAA demands a change in clinical practice and follow up given how crucial PROMs are, compared to their non-routinary use.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Association of linear growth velocities between 0 and 6 years with kidney function and size at 10 years: a birth cohort study in Ethiopia.\r\n Greater growth between 0-6 years of development was positively associated with kidney size and greater growth velocity after 2 years was associated with higher serum cystatin C level.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nChanges in Coffee Intake, Added Sugar and Long-Term Weight Gain - Results from Three Large Prospective US Cohort Studies.\r\nAn increase in intake of unsweetened caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee was inversely associated with weight gain. The addition of sugar to coffee counteracted coffee's benefit for possible weight management. On the other hand, adding cream or coffee whitener were not associated with greater weight gain.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEgg consumption and risk of coronary artery disease, potential amplification by high genetic susceptibility: a prospective cohort study.\r\nGenetic predisposition may synergistically interact with egg consumption in relation to increased CAD risk. PRS-stratified recommendations on egg consumption may help formulate personalized nutrition policies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOmega-6 fatty acid biomarkers and incident atrial fibrillation: an individual participant-level pooled analysis of 11 international prospective studies.\r\nBiomarkers of n-6 fatty acids including LA and AA were not associated with incident AF. These findings suggest that overall effects of n-6 PUFAs on influencing AF development are neutral.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPlasma Amino Acid Neurotransmitters and Ischemic Stroke Prognosis: A Multicenter Prospective Study.\r\nIncreased glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and gamma-aminobutyric acid and decreased glycine in plasma are associated with adverse outcomes after ischemic stroke, suggesting that plasma amino acid neurotransmitters may be potential intervention targets for improving prognosis of ischemic stroke. The CATIS trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (registration number  NCT01840072;  URL  ===\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTypes of Dairy Foods and Risk of Fragility Fracture in the Prospective Nurses' Health Study Cohort.\r\n Higher total dairy, milk and cheese intakes were associated with lower risks of fracture in females in NHS.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Appearance of the Bowel and Mesentery During Surgery Is Not Predictive of Postoperative Recurrence After Ileocecal Resection for Crohn's Disease: A Prospective Monocentric Study.\r\nThe macroscopic appearance of the bowel and associated mesentery during surgery does not seem to be predictive of POR after ileocecal resection for CD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nKONO-S Anastomosis Is Not Superior to Conventional Anastomosis for the Reduction of Postoperative Endoscopic Recurrence in Crohn's Disease.\r\nKono-S anastomosis was not associated with a reduced rate of endoscopic POR. These results warrant confirmation in prospective, randomized, multicenter studies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOutcome of Very Early Onset Inflammatory Bowel Disease Associated With Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis: A Multicenter Study From the Pediatric IBD Porto Group of ESPGHAN.\r\nPrimary sclerosing cholangitis related to inflammatory bowel disease has similar baseline characteristics whether diagnosed as VEO-IBD or thereafter. A milder disease course in terms of biliary complications characterizes VEO-PSC-IBD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Efficacy of an Over-the-Counter Multivitamin and Mineral Supplement to Prevent Infections in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Remission With Immunomodulators and/or Biological Agents: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial.\r\nAn over-the-counter multivitamin and mineral supplement did not reduce the risk of infection for patients with IBD in remission with immunomodulators, biologic therapy, or combination therapy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Baseline expression of immune gene modules in blood is associated with primary response to anti-TNF therapy in Crohn's disease patients.\r\nBaseline gene module expression was associated with primary response to anti-TNF therapy in PANTS patients. However, these baseline expression differences did not predict response with sufficient sensitivity for clinical use.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHLA signatures as pathophysiological discriminants of microscopic colitis subtypes.\r\n Our results suggest CC and LC have distinct pathophysiological underpinnings, characterised by an HLA predisposing role only in CC. This challenges existing classifications, eventually calling for a re-evaluation of the utility of MC umbrella definitions.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMaintenance Risankizumab Sustains Induction Response in Patients with Crohn's Disease in a Randomized Phase 3 Trial.\r\nSubcutaneous risankizumab maintenance therapy results in durable improvement in clinical and endoscopic outcomes over 1 year in patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSubmucosal injection of the RNA oligonucleotide GUT-1 in active ulcerative colitis patients: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2a induction trial.\r\n Single dosing by submucosal injection of GUT-1 repressed CHST15 mucosal expression and may represent a novel induction therapy by modulating tissue remodeling in UC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTofacitinib for patients with anti-TNF refractory ulcerative proctitis: a multicenter cohort study from the GETAID.\r\n Tofacitinib may offer a therapeutic option for patients with refractory UP.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    Autoimmune hepatitis recurrence after liver transplantation: \"Les jeux sont faits\".\r\nRecurrence of AIH after LT is frequent and may lead to graft loss. Recurrence is more frequent in young patients with active disease at the time of LT, yet systematic corticosteroid therapy does not prevent it.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOutcomes of living donor liver transplant recipients receiving grafts with the Graft-to-Recipient weight ratio less than 0.6%: A matched pair analysis.\r\nIn conclusions, although similar overall graft survival rates were observed for LDLT with GRWR <0.6% and GRWR =0.6%, GRWR <0.6% was associated with an increased risk of SFSS. Appropriate donor and recipient selection is important for successful LDLT with very small grafts.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOutcomes of re-referrals of patients with alcohol-related liver disease who were previously declined for liver transplantation.\r\n Patients with ALD previously declined for liver transplant can be re-referred and successfully accepted for transplantation by fulfilling the recommendations made by the multidisciplinary team. Important factors including ongoing abstinence, engagement in addiction treatment and social support are key for successful acceptance.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreas\r\n    Current Situation and Problems in Diagnosis of Early Chronic Pancreatitis.\r\nEarly chronic pancreatitis diagnostic rate was low, particularly in nonalcoholic cases, but was slightly higher in cases with pancreatic pain. The diagnostic rate was highest in the abdominal/back pain group. Further studies are required to establish appropriate diagnostic criteria for ECP.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPerioperative Chemotherapy and Chemoradiotherapy for Patients With Resectable and Borderline Resectable Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma.\r\nPerioperative therapy with GTX, chemoradiotherapy, and adjuvant GemOx/Gem resulted in promising survival of 58 months for patients who underwent resection and may represent another treatment option for PDA.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nResponse of Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer to Intratumoral Injection of Large Surface Area Microparticle Paclitaxel: Initial Report of Safety and Clinical Outcome.\r\nNeoadjuvant IT LSAM-PTX, in combination with SOC, was well tolerated and may provide benefits to LAPC patients, evidenced by enhanced immune response, improved disease control rate, restaging leading to surgery, and extended survival.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    Comparing fine needle biopsy techniques in solid pancreatic lesions: A prospective randomized study.\r\n When performing EUS-FNB for solid pancreatic lesions located in the head/uncinated process, the three methods provided similar diagnostic yields. The wet-suction technique had a higher score in tissue integrity when lesions were located in the body and/or tail of the pancreas.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEuropean' health care indicators and pancreatic cancer incidence and mortality: A mediation analysis of Eurostat data and Global Burden of Disease Study 2019.\r\nHealth care environment correlates with reported incidence and mortality of pancreatic cancer. This highlights both that ameliorated socio-economic societies suffer from higher incidence but lower mortality, as well as the epidemiological bias originating from countries' diagnostic ability.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRectal administration of tacrolimus protects against post-ERCP pancreatitis in mice.\r\n Our results underscore the effectiveness and clinical utility of rectal Tac for PEP prophylaxis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the publisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Amino acid neurotransmitters and prognosis after stroke: nutrition as a modifiable factor to improve stroke outcomes.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGenetic susceptibility modifies the association between egg consumption and coronary artery disease.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Disease Clearance is not Synonymous with Cure.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIs Ulcerative Colitis Really Ever \"Cleared?\"\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Lémman Index in Children: Still an Open Question.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    Pancreatic duct pressure: A review of technical aspects and clinical significance.\r\nDuctal hypertension or increased PDP is suspected to be involved in the pathogenesis of pancreatic pain, endocrine and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and recurrent pancreatitis.
