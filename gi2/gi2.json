These findings are crucial for the management of EIMs, especially hepatic manifestations, in IBD patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTemporary Faecal Diversion for Refractory Perianal and/or Distal Colonic Crohn's Disease in the Biologic Era: An Updated Systematic Review with Meta-Analysis.\r\n In the biologic era, temporary FD for refractory perianal and/or distal colonic CD improves symptoms half the patients, and bowel continuity can be successfully restored in a quarter of patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    Treatment strategies of hepatic artery complications after pediatric liver transplantation: A systematic review.\r\nDespite various treatment methods, HAT after pLT remains a significant issue that has profound effects on the patient and graft survivals. Current evidence is insufficient to determine the most effective treatment for preventing graft failure.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Dietary greenhouse gas emissions and diet quality in a cross-sectional study of Swedish adolescents.\r\nFood choices and dGHGE per calorie differ by sex in adolescents. Thus, intervention strategies to improve dietary sustainability need to be tailored differently to females and males. Diet quality should also be considered when promoting reduced GHGE diets.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Characterization of the Gut Microbiota and Mycobiota in Italian Pediatric Patients With Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis and Ulcerative Colitis.\r\nWe describe the gut microbiota and mycobiota dysbiosis associated to PSC-UC disease. Our results evidenced a gut imbalance, with the reduction of gut commensal microorganisms with stated anti-inflammatory properties (ie, Akkermansia, Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, Oscillospira, Meyerozyma, and Malassezia) and the increase of pathobionts (ie, Streptococcus, Saccharomyces, and Debaryomyces) that could be involved in PSC progression. Altogether, these events may concur in the pathophysiology of PSC in the framework of UC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nExpression of Circulating let-7e and miR-126 May Predict Clinical Remission in Patients With Crohn's Disease Treated With Anti-TNF-a Biologics.\r\n These results provide evidence that expression levels of circulating let-7e and miR-126 at baseline may predict clinical remission in CD patients treated with anti-TNF-a biologics.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRacial and Ethnic Disparities in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: An Online Survey.\r\nBIPOC/H patients with IBD had worse clinical disease, lower HRQOL scores, had more medication concerns, had less access to specialists, had less social and emotional support, and used emergency department services more often than W/NH patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Mitigating the risk of Tofacitinib-induced adverse events in the elderly population with Ulcerative Colitis.\r\nModulation of induction dose and anti-thrombotic therapy may have contributed to prevent cardiologic events and thromboembolism. The introduction of zoster vaccine virtually eliminated zoster risk after the first cases. Potential malignancies deserve a careful work-up of older patients before treatment start.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nProspective Observational Evaluation of the Time-Dependency of Adalimumab Immunogenicity and Drug Concentration in Ulcerative Colitis Patients: the POETIC II Study.\r\nLoss of response to adalimumab therapy was significantly more common in the Ulcerative Colitis compared to the Crohn's disease cohort and was driven by a higher rate of non-immunogenic, pharmacodynamic parameters.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nValidation of the IBD-Control Questionnaire across different sociodemographic and clinical subgroups: Secondary analysis of a nationwide electronic survey.\r\nIBD-Control-8 is a psychometrically robust scale which can be used across a range of populations.

In EBV seronegative recipients, PTLD occurred earlier after LT, while in the 97% seropositive recipients it could occur very late after LT.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    Greater cost without greater benefit: The need to refine transfer criteria for patients with severe acute pancreatitis.\r\n Transferred patients have greater burden of illness and cost of care without evidence of improved outcomes in the management of SAP regardless of procedural intervention. Transfer criteria for patients with SAP must be further refined to reduce unnecessary transfers.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the publisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Inflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Think Again Before Resecting an Organ: Appendectomy or Endoscopic Retrograde Appendicitis Therapy?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous\r\nmisc publications eg case reports, tools of the trade, images of the month, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Inflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Revisiting the Risk of Hospital Readmission in Severe Ulcerative Colitis.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Lémman Index in pediatric Crohn's disease - evidence is accumulating.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    Letter to the Editor: Blocked drain switch -- hepatic venous outflow obstruction.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReply: Blocked drain switch - hepatic venous outflow obstruction.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetters&Replies\r\nLetters to the editors and authors’ replies\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Cooking Skills: Essential for the Food is Medicine Movement.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
