As a non-invasive, point-of-care modality, IUS is recommended as the first-line imaging tool if there is a suspicion of CD-related intra-abdominal complications.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    Association of high-risk stigmata and worrisome features with advanced neoplasia in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN): A systematic review.\r\nThis systematic review provides evidence supporting the improved diagnostic accuracy of ICG2017 in identifying high-risk lesions of IPMN. The multidisciplinary incorporation of HRS and WF based on imaging findings and clinical symptoms is crucial. These findings should inform the revision of ICG2017, enhancing the evaluation and management of IPMN patients. By implementing these recommendations, clinicians can make more informed decisions, leading to better diagnosis and treatment outcomes for high-risk IPMN cases.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Changes in gut microbiota and lactose intolerance symptoms before and after daily lactose supplementation in individuals with the lactase non-persistent genotype.\r\nIncreased levels of Bifidobacterium indicate an adaptation of the gut microbiota upon repetitive consumption of incremental doses of lactose, which was well-tolerated as demonstrated by reduced expired hydrogen levels during the second 25g lactose HBT. Bifidobacteria metabolize lactose without gas production thereby potentially reducing intestinal gas formation in the gut of individuals with the LNP-genotype. This increased lactose tolerance possibly lifts the necessity to remove nutrient-rich dairy foods completely from the diet. Registration number of clinical trial The trial is registered at the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform  NL9516 The effect of dietary lactose in lactase non-persistent individuals on gut microbiota.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClimate-based variability in the essential fatty acid composition of soybean oil. \r\nFrom this work, it was determined that soybean oil manufactured from soybeans in the southern United States may contain insufficient ALA to meet human nutritional needs because of high-daytime temperatures. This work suggests that climate-based variation may result in many human populations not achieving an adequate daily intake of ALA.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEstimation of 24-hour urinary sodium and potassium excretion among Chinese adults: a cross-sectional study from the China National Nutrition Survey. \r\nThe first nationwide survey with 24-h urine collection confirmed that mean sodium intake in Chinese adults was more than twice the upper limit, whereas mean potassium intake was <60% of the lower limit, recommended by the World Health Organization. Urgent measures should be taken to reduce sodium intake and increase potassium intake in China.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFood Insecurity, Neighborhood Food Environment, and Health Disparities: State of the Science, Research Gaps and Opportunities.\r\nThe workshop had three research objectives: 1) summarize the state of the science and knowledge gaps related to food insecurity, neighborhood food environments, and nutrition health disparities, 2) identify research opportunities and strategies to address research gaps, and 3) examine evidence-based interventions and implementation approaches to address food insecurity and neighborhood food environments to promote health equity. This article summarizes workshop proceedings and describes research gaps and future opportunities that emerged from discussions.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHemoglobin measurement in venous blood versus single-drop and pooled capillary blood: A method-comparison study in a controlled and survey setting in Uganda among children and women. \r\nFuture research is also needed to evaluate the implications of using venous versus capillary blood in population-based surveys. 720-OAA-18C-00083; \r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLow dose daily folic acid (400 µg) supplementation does not affect regulation of folate transporters found present throughout the terminal ileum and colon of humans: a randomized clinical trial.\r\nFolate transporters are present throughout the terminal ileum and colon;  there is little evidence that a low dose folic acid supplementation affects colonic absorption.

This work adds to our understanding of the role of fungi in IBD, with potential clinical implications.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPhosphoproteomics Reveals Novel Insights into the Pathogenesis and Identifies New Therapeutic Kinase Targets of Ulcerative Colitis.\r\nOur research deepened the understanding of UC pathogenesis through the lens of phosphorylation. Moreover, we identified CDK2 as a new potential therapeutic target for UC, revealing a novel role for CDK2 in necroptosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Efficacy and Safety of the Anti-Mucosal Addressin Cell Adhesion Molecule-1 Antibody Ontamalimab in Patients with Moderate-to-Severe Ulcerative Colitis or Crohn's Disease.\r\nOntamalimab 75 mg was effective with no safety concerns as induction and maintenance therapy for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEpigenetic and metabolic reprogramming of fibroblasts in Crohn's disease strictures reveals histone deacetylases as therapeutic targets.\r\nIncreased HDAC expression profiles, H3K27ac hypoacetylation, a significant glycolytic phenotype, and metabolic priming, characterise SCD-derived as compared to NSCD fibroblasts. Our results reveal a novel epigenetic component to Collagen-I regulation and TGFß-mediated CD fibrosis. HDAC inhibitor therapy may 'reset' the epigenetic changes associated with fibrosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRisankizumab Induction Therapy Achieves Early Symptom Improvements That Are Associated With Future Clinical and Endoscopic Outcomes in Crohn's Disease: Post Hoc Analysis of the ADVANCE, MOTIVATE, and FORTIFY Phase 3 Studies.\r\nAfter the first intravenous RZB induction dose, significantly greater rates of symptom improvement versus PBO were achieved. Improvements could be observed as early as week 1 and were predictive of week 12 and 52 clinical and endoscopic improvement.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    Development of a model to predict the risk of early graft failure after adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantation: An ELTR study.\r\nThe model also stratified long-term graft survival (p<0.001), which ranged from 87% in the low risk group to 60% in the high risk group. In conclusion, based on a panel of donor and recipient variables, an ANN can contribute to decision making in ALDLT by predicting EGF risk.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDiscarded livers tested by normothermic machine perfusion in the VITTAL trial: Secondary end points and 5-year outcomes.\r\nThis first report of long-term outcomes of high-risk livers assessed by normothermic machine perfusion demonstrated excellent 5-year survival without adverse effects in al organs functioning beyond 1 year (ClinicalTrials. gov number NCT02740608).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFinancial burden after liver transplantation is significant among commercially insured adults: A large U.S. National Cohort.\r\n In a large national cohort of commercially insured LT recipients, financial liability was highly variable across sociodemographic and clinical characteristics;  nearly 1 out 2 LT recipients owed>$5K for 1 year of post-LT care. Transplant programs should help patients anticipate potential costs and identify vulnerable populations who would benefit from enhanced financial counseling.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNeighborhood-level social determinants of health measures independently predict receipt of living donor liver transplantation in the U.S.\r\nOf the 24 neighborhood-level SDoH measures studied, the SDI was most different between the two transplant types, with LDLT recipients having lower SDI (i. e., less socioeconomic disadvantage) than DDLT recipients (median SDI 37 vs 47;  p 40.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nWaitlist and post-transplant outcomes of pregnancy-related acute liver failure in the United States.\r\n In this UNOS database analysis of ALF among women of childbearing age, the waitlist outcome is better in women with P-ALF compared to NP-ALF. Among women with P-ALF, the 90-day WLM is worse for HELLP vs AFLP.
