This intervention should be evaluated in other populations with excessive SSB consumption.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAssociations of Prepregnancy Weight Change with Fetal Growth and Adverse Birth Outcomes: A Prospective Cohort Study in China.\r\nExcessive prepregnancy weight gain was associated with accelerated fetal growth and increased macrosomia and LGA risks, whereas prepregnancy weight loss showed a sex-specific impact on SGA. The combination of high prepregnancy weight gain and excessive GWG was associated with the highest risks of macrosomia and LGA.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHuman milk oligosaccharides and Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli gastroenteritis risk in a Nicaraguan birth cohort.\r\nConsuming high concentrations of 2'FL early in infants' lives was not protective against C. jejuni/coli gastroenteritis in this prospective birth cohort. However, high concentrations of LNnT and LSTc, and possibly LNFP-III may be associated with decreased C. jejuni/coli gastroenteritis and warrant investigation as potential supplements for C. jejuni/coli gastroenteritis prevention in chest-fed and formula-fed children. Safety testing for HMOs as supplements is needed for regions with prevalent enteric infections.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPlant to animal protein ratio in the diet of the elderly: potential for increase and impacts on nutrient adequacy and long-term health - a diet optimization study.\r\nDiets must be sufficiently rich in protein to ensure protein adequacy at higher requirements, with no risk of IAA inadequacy when protein intake is sufficient. For sustainability, %PP can potentially increase from the current ∼⅓ to ∼⅔ in an aging population while improving health and nutrient adequacy, provided sufficient seafood and dairy products remain. Further increases would require nutrient fortification/supplementation and/or new foods.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRethinking balanced food supplementation for pregnant women: time to move beyond energy and protein.\r\nWe articulate the need to carefully consider the goals of food supplementation during pregnancy, the biological mechanisms underlying effects on key outcomes, the desirability of flexibility in approaches, cost considerations, and the needs of the entire household in the context of food insecurity. We conclude that it is time to redefine the concept of balanced food supplementation for pregnant women, clarify objectives and terminology, and conduct further research relevant to the current global context.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    A Guide to the Patient-Centric Use of Vedolizumab for Crohn's Disease.\r\nWe detail the ability of vedolizumab to achieve mucosal healing and alter disease progression and present the evidence that supports the use of vedolizumab as a first-line biologic early in the disease course in patients with CD. Finally, we address some of the perceived drawbacks of using vedolizumab in CD, including concerns about slow onset of action, impact of disease location, and exacerbation of extraintestinal manifestations.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nComparative Predictive Utility of MM-SES-CD and SES-CD for Week 52 Endoscopic Remission in the Ileum and Colon in Crohn's Disease.\r\n The baseline MM-SES-CD demonstrated superior predictive ability for week 52 ER compared to SES-CD across the ileum and colon. These findings support its utility in clinical trials and in routine practice for predicting long-term treatment response.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFood Compounds Associated With Disease Activity in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\nWe identified several compounds that may play a modulatory role in IBD.

Further research is needed to determine the underlying mechanisms behind these potential associations.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Gene-Environment Interactions in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review of Human Epidemiologic Studies.\r\nCurrent evidence indicated that the IBD risk conferred by environmental factors can vary among the individuals carrying certain genetic variants. Further efforts, including genome wide environment interaction studies and genotype-based nutrition/lifestyle clinical trials, are needed to unravel the missing heritability influenced by environmental exposures and to construct personalized recommendations of lifestyle/dietary modification based on an individual genetic background.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    Association between ABO blood groups and pancreatic cancer outcomes: A systematic review and meta-analysis.\r\nPatients with blood type O exhibited better OS and were less frequently diagnosed with advanced cancer stages (III-IV) upon presentation compared to those with non-O blood types. Further research is needed to investigate the mechanisms underlying these associations.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Adherence to plant-based diets and long-term changes in cardiometabolic markers: a longitudinal analysis in a population-based cohort.\r\nGreater adherence to more plant-based dietary patterns, particularly those rich in healthy plant-based foods, is associated with favorable long-term changes in early cardiometabolic markers. Our findings provide further support for recommendations to transition to more healthy plant-based diets for early prevention of cardiometabolic risk.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAssessment of immune function in individuals without and with obesity and normoglycemia, glucose intolerance, or type 2 diabetes: primary findings of the NutrIMM study, a single-arm controlled feeding trial.\r\nImmune function is compromised in obesity and worsens in T2D, suggesting both obesity and poor glucose control drive immune dysfunction. Addressing metabolic health may help mitigate immune dysfunction and inflammation in obesity-related conditions.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nBiomarkers of environmental enteric dysfunction and neurodevelopmental outcomes among children in rural Bangladesh and Kenya: a prospective cohort study.\r\nHigher concentrations of biomarkers of intestinal permeability were associated with poor child motor development in Bangladesh. These relationships were not replicated in the Kenyan cohort. The associations between EED and child neurodevelopment vary across geographical contexts, highlighting the need for further research to determine the generalizability of these findings.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCan nutrition-sensitive agriculture interventions address intersectional inequalities in women's diets? A mediation analysis using cross-sectional trial data from Odisha, India.\r\nTo our knowledge, this is the first intersectionality-informed analysis of nutrition interventions. UPAVAN interventions mostly has equitable impacts, reducing several inequalities in maternal diet quality. We demonstrate how intersectionality-informed analyses can help identify inequities in nutrition interventions and inform the design of inclusive interventions that reach and benefit the most marginalized groups.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDuration and intensity of lactation and maternal risk of subsequent incident coronary artery disease and stroke-a prospective cohort study.\r\nLimited evidence exists for an association between lactation and maternal risk of stroke. Longer durations of lactation are associated with lower risks of maternal CAD diagnosed before age 70 y. Adjustment for risk factors attenuate the associations, which suggests these factors may partly confound the benefits of lactation on maternal risks of CAD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEffects of a palmitoleic acid concentrated oil on C-reactive protein levels in adults: A randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial.\r\nCompared to placebo, supplementation for 12 wk with 500 mg/d or 1000 mg/d POA did not significantly lower hs-CRP or change other biomarkers.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLongitudinal Associations Between Vegetarian Dietary Habits and Site-Specific Cancers in the Adventist Health Study-2 North American cohort.\r\nThese data indicate lower risk in vegetarians for al cancers combined, also for medium frequency cancers as a group. Specific cancers with evidence of lower risk, are breast, colorectal, prostate, stomach, and lymphoproliferative subtypes. Risk at some other sites may also differ in vegetarians, but statistical power was limited.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMetabolic profile of biodiverse diets in a healthy European cohort.\r\n In this European middle-aged adult population, the circulating metabolic profiles of biodiverse diets are consistent with the metabolome linked with health-promoting diets, indicating metabolite groups that provide metabolic homeostasis, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative stress, and anti-obesogenic properties. These findings support the health benefits of consuming more diverse dietary species and may partially explain the inverse associations found in relation with mortality or gastrointestinal cancer.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMortality burden of protein-energy malnutrition associated with ambient temperature in China:a nationwide case-crossover study.\r\nFindings from this nationwide study suggest that both heat and cold are associated with increased risks and burden of PEM-related deaths. These findings underscore the necessity of targeted interventions to reduce the PEM-related mortality burden associated with ambient temperature.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNutritional priorities to support GLP-1 therapy for obesity: a joint Advisory from the American College of Lifestyle Medicine, the American Society for Nutrition, the Obesity Medicine Association, and The Obesity Society.\r\nEvidence-based nutritional and lifestyle strategies play a pivotal role to address key challenges around GLP-1 treatment of obesity, making clinicians more effective in advancing their patients' health.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOne-carbon metabolism-related compounds are associated with epigenetic aging biomarkers: results from the cross-sectional National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002.\r\nIn a nationally representative sample of United States adults, higher concentration of folate, a carbon donor, was associated with lower EAD, and higher concentration of Hcys, an indicator of OCM deficiencies, was associated with greater EAD;  however, some associations were influenced by smoking and renal function. Future research should focus on high-risk populations. Long-term randomized controlled trials are also needed to establish causality and investigate the clinical relevance of changes in EAD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPaving the way for improved action: how nuclear techniques can advance the assessment of malnutrition.\r\nThe integration of nuclear techniques with emerging tools such as artificial intelligence and model-based compartmental analysis was emphasized as a key strategy to enhance their utility. This report also highlights the important role of nuclear techniques in addressing malnutrition and calls for interdisciplinary collaboration and reduced research silos to fully leverage these techniques to combat this condition more effectively.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nShort-Term High Fat Diet Induced Metabolic Endotoxemia in Older Individuals with Obesity: A Randomized Crossover Study.\r\n Serum endotoxin concentrations in individuals with obesity increase following a HF diet or meal and these data suggest it is explained by intestinal permeability rather than a shift in the gut microbiome. Clinical trial registration\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe potential of nighttime urine samples for epidemiologic research on sodium intake: Evidence from a population-based cohort study in Switzerland.\r\nEstimating 24-h UNa excretion based on nighttime collections was found to be imprecise and/or biased at the individual level and failed to capture population-level characteristics beyond central tendency.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nUltra-processed foods, plant and animal sources, and all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality in older adults in the United States: results from the Cardiovascular Health Study.\r\n Higher consumption of UPF and plant- and animal-sourced UPFs was associated with higher risk of all-cause, non-CVD-related, and cancer mortality. Our findings emphasize the need to consider the impact of food processing, even in plant-sourced foods, to prevent a shorter lifespan in older adults. Findings on plant-sourced UPF and mortality require replication.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Achievement of long-term treatment goals in upadacitinib-treated patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis: a post hoc analysis of phase 3 trial data.\r\n Upadacitinib may help patients with moderately to severely active UC achieve complete symptom resolution, endoscopic remission, and normalization of HRQoL.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAssociation between Food Diversity in the Infant Period and the Risk of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Nationwide Cohort Study in South Korea.\r\n Food diversity, combined with frequency of solid food intake, during infancy is associated with the incidence of ulcerative colitis. Promoting a diverse diet during infancy may be important in preventing the development of IBD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCancer Incidence in Patients with Ulcerative Colitis Naïve to or Treated with Thiopurine and Targeted Therapies- a cohort study 2007 to 2022 with comparison to the general population.\r\n Elevated cancer incidence was observed in patients with UC amounting to around 3 extra cases of cancer per 1000 years. Cancer risks varied more among groups defined by age than by treatment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImpact Of Immunomodulating Medication On Maternal Tdap Vaccination Induced Antibodies In Infants.\r\nMaternal Tdap vaccination in women with IBD receiving immunomodulating medication during pregnancy results in significantly higher Tdap-antibody concentrations in their infants compared to infants of unvaccinated IBD mothers, although GMC was lower for PRN compared to healthy controls. These results support current recommendations to advise maternal Tdap vaccination in pregnant women receiving immunomodulating medication.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImpact of Mirikizumab Treatment on Fatigue in Patients with Moderately to Severely Active Crohn's Disease: Results from the Phase 3 VIVID-1 Study.\r\nMirikizumab-treated patients with Crohn's disease achieved higher rates of clinically meaningful improvement in fatigue versus placebo at Weeks 12 and 52, which correlated with improvement in clinical and patient-reported outcomes. Baseline fatigue severity was strongly associated with depressive symptoms in VIVID-1 (NCT03926130).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLong-term disease course of ulcerative colitis in a prospective European population-based inception cohort - an Epi-IBD cohort study.\r\nWhile the introduction of advanced therapies for UC has transformed the therapeutic landscape, their impact on colectomy rates, disease progression, and hospitalisations remains modest. Our findings highlight the need for continued innovation in UC treatment and the importance of individualised and targeted care to achieve optimal long-term outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMetabolism and Response to Stress Gene Signatures Reveal Ulcerative Colitis Heterogeneity and Identify Patients With Increased Response to Therapy.\r\nWe identified and evaluated a novel, multi-dimensional signature gene set to characterise previously undefined heterogeneity in patients with UC and identify patients less likely to respond to therapy. This approach offers potential utility to define clinical trial populations, enrich for clinical responders, and identify difficult-to-treat populations for therapeutic development.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPharmacological inhibitors of the gamma-secretase enzyme complex disrupt epithelial cell function triggering colitis in mice.\r\nIn conclusion, systemic use of γ-secretase inhibitors disrupts epithelial cell function by impairing IEC differentiation and triggering gut inflammation in mice. These findings should be considered when designing future therapeutic interventions involving γ-secretase inhibitors.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nST6GAL1 promotes IBD B cell recruitment to the inflamed colon in a CD22-dependent mechanism.\r\nOur findings suggest that endothelial ST6GAL1 creates a pro-adhesive microenvironment rich in α2,6-sialic acids that engage CD22 on circulating B cells and plasmablasts to promote their recruitment into the inflamed gut mucosa. This pathway might be a novel target to interfere with B lineage cell homing and local auto-antibody production.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Effectiveness of second-and-third line biologics in perianal Crohn's disease - a multicenter propensity score-matched study.\r\n In pCD patients failing anti-TNFs as 1st-line treatment, ustekinumab may be more effective than vedolizumab or another anti-TNFs as 2nd or 3rd-line therapy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    Abdominal aortic calcification on routine pre-operative computed tomography - a novel cardiovascular risk prediction tool in liver transplant patients.\r\nHigh AAC on routine CT scans was associated with a 3-fold increased risk of 30-day MACE post-LT and improved cardiovascular risk prediction compared to traditional indices. Quantification of AAC may offer a simple method of improving cardiovascular risk assessment in these patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAccess to early liver transplantation is adversely impacted by social determinants of health: A retrospective cohort study.\r\nHigh SVI census tracts were less likely to have individuals referred for ALD compared to tracts with low SVI (IRR 0.53, 95% CI 0.42-0.66). Both individual- and neighborhood-level SDoH are important factors that ultimately influence who is eligible for transplant.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nBalancing abstinence and harm reduction across the continuum of care for liver transplantation in alcohol-associated liver disease.\r\nBased on clinical evidence, we highlight the need to examine current LT selection processes, coordinate alcohol use disorder treatment for patients with ALD, and develop comprehensive markers of post-transplant success. Finally, we discuss potential challenges and considerations when applying the harm reduction approach to nuanced scenarios of LT candidates and recipients with ALD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatic hypoxia in donation after circulatory death: Physiology, clinical relevance, & future directions.\r\nLastly, we touch on emerging technologies such as machine perfusion. We hope that our review unites concepts of hepatic physiology with DCD practice and enlightens readers to envision novel areas of study in this field.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nManagement of obesity in liver transplant candidates & recipients: Rethinking the false dichotomy between pharmacotherapy and surgical intervention.\r\nExperts in the field presented the available data and smaller working groups had interactive breakout sessions that identified knowledge gaps and developed recommendations. This perspective prepared on behalf the participants of the AST Controversies Conference on obesity and liver transplant aims to summarize the available evidence for surgical and pharmaceutical treatment in the liver transplantation population.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPeri- and postoperative analgesic strategies in live donor hepatectomy: A national survey.\r\n We observed a significant variation in peri- and postoperative pain management strategies after live donor hepatectomy between centers. Some centers adapt analgesic techniques based on the surgical technique (e.g., open vs laparoscopic/robotic, and right vs left lobe hepatectomy).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRenal replacement therapy in liver transplant ineligible patients.\r\nEmerging literature suggests that the etiology of kidney injury should play less of a role in clinical decision making. Decisions around RRT are often influenced by medical, ethical, and end-of life factors and should be made in conjunction with patients and their caregivers.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRobotic liver transplantation: University of modena experience.\r\nThe robotic approach to liver transplantation has demonstrated feasibility and promising short-term outcomes. However, extended follow-up is required to confirm these results over the long term with the aim to confirm outcomes comparable to benchmark results of open transplantation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSteatotic liver disease after paediatric liver transplantation.\r\nTherefore, steatotic liver disease is a noteworthy histological feature during the follow-up of paediatric liver transplant recipients, yet it had a low burden on the health of the patients in this cohort. However, it needs to be monitored in the context of the increasing prevalence of metabolic syndrome.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    Pancreatic parenchymal volume measurement for predicting invasive intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm.\r\nQuantifying PV, particularly when combined with HRS, may improve diagnostic accuracy for invasive IPMN. Furthermore, changes in PV observed during surveillance may provide additional insight into the risk of progression to invasive IPMN.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPerilesional branch duct dilation as a hallmark MRCP feature for differentiating high-grade PanIN from low-grade PanIN.\r\nPerilesional BPD dilation on MRCP is a primary imaging feature for differentiating HG-PanIN, characterized by substantial interobserver agreement. While PPA on MRI is another important independent predictor, its lower interobserver agreement warrants caution. These findings highlight the diagnostic value of utilizing both MRCP and MRI in the noninvasive evaluation of suspected PanIN.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    A key step toward gaining a deeper understanding of individual responses to protein supplementation.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDietary species richness: first steps toward understanding its relationship with health.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHeightened inflammation and immune impairments in those living with obesity may be worsened by coexistence of type 2 diabetes.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nYou are what you don't eat.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Hit the road JAK: is there still hope left for TYK2 inhibition in IBD?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous\r\nmisc publications eg case reports, tools of the trade, images of\r\nthe month, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Inflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Diagnostic Challenges in EBV-Associated B-Cell Lymphoproliferative Disorder.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLack of Efficacy of Concomitant 5-Aminosalicylic Acid With Vedolizumab in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Large-Scale Administrative Database Analysis.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    The use of endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle biopsy for the diagnosis of microcystic serous cystic neoplasms of the pancreas.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetters&Replies\r\nLetters to the editors and authors’ replies\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Assessing the impact of subrecommended gestational weight gain in overweight and obese pregnancies.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLeveraging established continuous glucose monitor accuracy study methods to enhance research in people not living with diabetes.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSystematic reviews informing the Dietary Guidelines for Americans are conducted and reported using rigorous approaches that align with current standards.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
