Cu concentration was strongly correlated with APRs and infection status suggesting its potential role in inflammation, a pathway implicated in the mechanisms of PTB. Therefore, maternal Cu could be used as potential marker of integrated inflammatory pathways during pregnancy and risk for preterm birth.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Children's energy intake generally increases in response to the energy density of meals but varies with the amounts and types of foods served.\r\nChildren's energy intake generally increased with greater ED;  at higher-ED meals, however, energy intake decreased in a curvilinear manner without a clear breakpoint. This reduction in intake at higher ED could be explained by meal-related factors such as the portions served, rather than by sensitivity to meal energy content.

Among participants with lower kidney function, TMAO was positively, and betaine negatively, associated with CVD. These results further our understanding of the potential role for choline metabolism on CVD risk.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHigher ultra-processed food intake is associated with adverse liver outcomes: a prospective cohort study of UK Biobank participants.\r\nHigher UPF intake is associated with an increased risk of NAFLD, liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, and severe liver disease, and adverse levels of multiple clinical biomarkers, suggesting the potential importance of reducing UPF intake to improve liver health.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMetabolic adaptation is associated with a greater increase in appetite following weight loss: a longitudinal study.\r\n A larger metabolic adaptation during weight loss is accompanied by a greater drive to eat. This might help explain the inter-individual differences in weight loss outcomes to dietary interventions.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Are Depression and Anxiety Underdiagnosed in Socially Vulnerable Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease?\r\nDisparities in the diagnoses of depression and anxiety for socially vulnerable patients with IBD exist. Awareness of these inequities is the first step toward developing interventions to improve mental health screening, eliminate barriers and bias, and promote referrals for appropriate mental health management.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDysregulated Immunity to Clostridioides difficile in IBD Patients Without a History of Recognized Infection.\r\nThese data suggest that IBD patients, potentially due to underlying intestinal dysbiosis, experience undiagnosed C. difficile infections that result in impaired toxin-specific immunity. This may contribute to the development of inflammatory T cell responses toward commensal bacteria and provide a rationale for C. difficile testing in IBD patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEnteric Infection at Flare of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Impacts Outcomes at 2 Years.\r\nEnteric infection at flare-specifically with CDI-is associated with worse IBD outcomes at 2 years. The relationship between E. coli subtypes at flare and subsequent IBD outcomes requires further investigation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflammatory Bowel Disease in Adults and Elderly: The Use of Selected Non-IBD Medication Examined in a Nationwide Cohort Study.\r\nIn al 3 age groups, the proportions of patients with redeemed prescriptions for several groups of non-IBD medication were significantly increased after the IBD diagnosis compared with before. The risk of becoming an incident user for several groups of non-IBD medication was increased in elderly patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLongitudinal Trends in Pregnancy Outcomes Among Women With Inflammatory Bowel Disease in the Era of Biologics: A 20-Year Nationwide Analysis.\r\n Over a 20-year period, live deliveries amongst women with IBD have increased.

However, there is still demonstrable risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in patients with IBD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nObesity, Sarcopenia and Myosteatosis: Impact on Clinical Outcomes in the Operative Management of Crohn's Disease.\r\n Myosteatosis is associated with nutritional impairment and predicts increased overall postoperative morbidity following resection for CD. Despite its association with specific increased postoperative risks, increased adiposity does not increase overall morbidity, reflecting preservation of nutritional status and relatively more quiescent disease phenotype. Impaired muscle mass and function represent an appealing target for patient optimization to improve outcomes in the surgical management of CD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPlasma Extracellular Vesicle LncRNA H19 as a Potential Diagnostic Biomarker for Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.\r\nOur study suggests that circulating EV-lncRNA H19 exhibited promising potential for the diagnosis of active IBD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Analysis of Clinical Trial Screen Failures in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD): Real World Results from the International Organization for the study of IBD.\r\n This first multicenter study analyzing reasons for non-enrollment in IBD RCTs shown that we lose patients at each step. Eligibility criteria, the risk of placebo assignment and insufficient disease activity were part of the main barriers.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFrailty screening associates with hospitalization and decline in quality of life and functional status in older patients with inflammatory bowel disease.\r\nFrailty screening associates with worse health outcomes in older patients with IBD. Further studies are needed to assess feasibility and effectiveness of implementation in routine care.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJanus kinase inhibitors differentially inhibit specific cytokine signals in the mesenteric lymph node cells of IBD patients.\r\nDespite their similarities, differences exist in the relative potencies of different JAKinibs against distinct cytokine families to explain their clinical efficacy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLymphoma In Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Multicenter Collaborative Study Between Getaid And Lysa.\r\n Lymphomas occurring in IBD patients do not seem to have a worse outcome than in patients without IBD. Due to the scarcity of this situation, those patients should be managed in expert centers.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMatrix metalloproteinases in intestinal fibrosis.\r\nThe exact regulation and role(s) of these MMPs in fibrosis are far from understood. Here, we review the current literature about ECM remodeling by MMPs in intestinal fibrosis and their potential role as biomarkers for disease progression or druggable targets.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOzanimod-Exposed Patients with Ulcerative Colitis Undergoing Total Colectomy Exhibit Unique Lymph Node Histologic Changes.\r\n This study identifies unique histologic changes in the lymph nodes of patients with UC treated with ozanimod. The presence of sinus histiocytosis and dilated sinuses is in keeping with the known mechanism of action of ozanimod and suggests that blocking lymphocyte egression from lymph nodes was insufficient to ameliorate disease severity in these patients. The possibility of Castleman-like features identified in several of the cases, needs to be further investigated.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    Psychosocial evaluation of living liver Donors- State of current practices in the US.\r\nPsycho-social contraindications to living liver donation vary amongst the transplant programs. Mental health follow-up of donor candidates is not standardized.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreas\r\n    Historical Review of Acute Pancreatitis Research Over the Last 80 Years.\r\n Over the past 80 years, the pathogenesis, treatment, risk management, and experimental model were the main research highlights. Optimal supportive management, minimally invasive treatment, and prediction of prognosis are subjects of interest for clinical practitioners;  signal transduction to identify a target for precise treatment is the focus of experimental research in AP.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    Acute pancreatitis in Turkey: Results of a nationwide multicenter study.\r\nThis prospective study provides an extensive report on clinical characteristics, management and outcomes of AP in real-world practice. Mortality remains high in severe cases and physicians' adherence to guidelines during management of the disease needs improvement in some aspects.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nComparison of different intensive triglyceride-lowering therapies in patients with hyperlipidemic acute pancreatitis.\r\nEarly CVVH lowers TG levels more efficiently than NS alone or CT therapy, but is not superior in terms of clinical outcomes and costs. NS also lowers TG levels and is significantly less costly than the other two treatments. Further multicenter studies are needed to determine the feasibility of NS alone treatment for HLAP patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDeterminants and outcomes of acute pancreatitis in patients hospitalized for COVID-19: Early pandemic experience.\r\nIn hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the presence of AP is associated with increased mortality and morbidity.

The higher the level of stool GIP, the better the predictive value of serology and dietitian interview. Stool GIP is a useful and practical test for GFD monitoring, particularly for risky gluten exposure in real life scenario.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDairy consumption and incident prediabetes: prospective associations and network models in the large population-based Lifelines study.\r\nIn this large cohort of Dutch adults, low-fat milk intake was associated with higher prediabetes risk. Heterogeneous associations by dairy type and fat content might partly be attributed to confounding caused by behaviors and food intake related to dairy intake.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSerum selenium, selenoprotein P and glutathione peroxidase 3 during early and late pregnancy in association with gestational diabetes mellitus: prospective Odense Child Cohort.\r\nLow serum selenium in pregnancy, particularly GPX3 activity is independently associated with the risk of GDM and LGA. Offering Se status assessment in pregnancy identifies females at high risk for GDM, who may benefit from Se substitution.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Adverse Events and Compliance Among Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients Treated With Home- vs Office-Based Biologic Infusions.\r\nThe home-based infusion of biologics for IBD appears safe with lower rates of major adverse events compared with office-based infusions. However, those receiving home infusion were less likely to receive correct weight-based dosing for infliximab and were poorly adherent to routine follow-up.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCrohn's Disease of the Ileoanal Pouch: A High Rate of Potential Overdiagnoses.\r\n Re-evaluation of cross-sectional imaging of the pouch revealed that potential alternative causes were found in nearly half of CDP patients. Cross-sectional imaging is therefore recommended early in the diagnostic pathway to exclude an alternative diagnosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDe Novo Crohn's Disease in Children With Ulcerative Colitis Undergoing Ileal Pouch-Anal Anastomosis: A Multicenter, Retrospective Study From the Pediatric IBD Porto Group of the ESPGHAN.\r\nChildren with UC undergoing IPAA carry a high risk of developing subsequent CD. De novo CD cases showed decreased preoperative body mass index z scores, identifying a poor nutritional status as a possible predictive factor.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDe Novo Crohn's Disease in the Pediatric Pouch.\r\nThe surgically altered environment of the ileal pouch is at risk of a spectrum of ileal pouch disorders, which have limited description in children. In this issue of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases, a multicenter, retrospective study of children with UC who underwent IPAA and developed de novo CD highlights the challenges and opportunities of ileal pouch characterization in children.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFocus on Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors-related Intestinal Inflammation: From Pathogenesis to Therapeutical Approach.\r\nHerein, we performed an insight of the main IRAEs associated with ICIs, focusing on gastroenterological IRAEs and specifically on checkpoint inhibitor colitis, which represents the most widely reported IRAE to date. We comprehensively dissected the current evidence regarding pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of ICIs-induced colitis, touching upon also on innovative therapies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Baseline TREM-1 Whole Blood Gene Expression Does Not Predict Response to Adalimumab Treatment in Patients with Ulcerative Colitis or Crohn's Disease in the SERENE Studies.\r\nBaseline TREM-1 gene expression did not uniformly predict adalimumab response in SERENE clinical trials. Further research is needed to identify potential blood-based biomarkers predictive of response to anti-TNF therapy in patients with IBD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDeep learning models capture histological disease activity in Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis with high fidelity.\r\nDeep learning models based upon GHAS and Geboes scoring systems were effective at distinguishing between the presence and absence of IBD microscopic disease activity.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMaintenance Risankizumab Sustains Induction Response in Patients with Crohn's Disease in a Randomized Phase 3 Trial.\r\nSubcutaneous risankizumab maintenance therapy results in durable improvement in clinical and endoscopic outcomes over 1 year in patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTofacitinib for patients with anti-TNF refractory ulcerative proctitis: a multicenter cohort study from the GETAID.\r\n Tofacitinib may offer a therapeutic option for patients with refractory UP.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nValidation of the pharmacokinetic model for anti- TNFa clearance in infants exposed to anti- TNFa during pregnancy.\r\nThe validity of the anti-TNFa clearance model is high, and hence can be used to guide clinicians regarding timing of live vaccines in infants exposed to adalimumab or infliximab in utero.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    Decreased need for RRT in liver transplant recipients after pretransplant treatment of hepatorenal syndrome-type 1 with terlipressin.\r\nThe post-transplant need for RRT, at 12 months, was significantly lower among those patients who received terlipressin and were alive at Day 365, compared to placebo (p=0.009). Pre-transplant treatment with terlipressin plus albumin in patients with HRS-1 decreased the need for RRT pre- and post-transplant.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe impact of health literacy on adolescent and young adult pediatric liver transplant recipients.\r\nThis study demonstrates that limited HL is associated with decreased measures of TR. Inadequate HL may be an unrecognized barrier to successful HCT. Regular assessment of HL may provide an opportunity for intervention prior to transfer of care. Future studies should investigate the impact of these interventions on long-term medical outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreas\r\n    Factors Associated With Serial Lipase Measurement in Hospitalized Patients With Acute Pancreatitis.\r\n More than one-third of AP patients undergo serial lipase measurements. This practice is more likely to occur on surgical services and in nontertiary hospitals.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGeriatric Nutritional Risk Index Predicts Tolerability of S-1 as Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.\r\nHigh GNRI value is a predictive marker for the completion of S-1 as AC for PDAC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatic Cancer Cells May Adhere to the External Surface of the Puncture Needle After Endoscopic Ultrasound-Guided Fine-Needle Aspiration.\r\n Pancreatic cancer cells may adhere to the puncture needle's external surface after EUS-FNA. Wiping the needle with alcohol swabs after each puncture effectively removes residual cancer cells.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPredictive Value of Antithrombin III and d-Dimer in the Development of Moderate-To-Severe Acute Pancreatitis: A Prospective, Observational Study (AT-PROPANC).\r\n Low AT-III and high d-dimer plasma levels at 24 hours after admission were significantly associated with MSAP/SAP, although their predictive ability was low. C-reactive protein was the best marker tested. Clinical study identifier ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02373293.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRetrospective Evaluation of the Efficacy of Gemcitabine-Based Therapies After FOLFIRINOX Failure in Advanced Pancreatic Cancer, Multi-Center Real-Life Data.\r\n In conclusion, it has been shown that gemcitabine-based second-line treatments contribute to survival in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.
