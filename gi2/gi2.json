This report presents 28 recommendations from the working group focused on addressing clinically relevant questions related to the preoperative aspects of living donor safety including assessment of donor acceptability (age, body mass index and hepatic steatosis;  medical conditions and contraindications), medical and surgical workup (liver function and procoagulant work-up;  anatomical considerations and safe remnant), and psychosocial evaluation (timing and team;  underlying conditions;  non-directed, paired, and anonymous directed donors;  urgent living donor workups for acute liver failure).\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Pancreas\n    Bridging Guidelines and Patient Preferences in IPMN Care.\n\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \n\n\nMeta-analysis\nmeta-analyses and systematic reviews\n\n\n    \n\n\nOriginal articles\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\n\n\n    Am J Clin Nutr\n    Alignment with Front-of-Package Labelling Policy and Risk of Hospitalization: Evidence from Canadian National Nutrition Survey Linked to Routinely Collected Health Administrative Databases.\nIn this exploratory analysis, greater alignment with FOP policy was associated with fewer hospital bed-days over 5 and 10 years. Sex-tailored risk-reduction strategies may be warranted with the strongest association in males. These findings reinforce the value of the \"high-in\" symbol;  however, the nutrient-specific focus may still miss broader dimensions of diet quality. Complementary, whole-diet guidance remains essential to maximise population-level benefits and health-system savings.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Comparing Postprandial Inflammatory Responses to a Plant-Based Meat Alternative, Grass-Finished Beef, and Grain-Finished Beef in Healthy Middle-Aged Adults: A Three-Group Randomized Crossover Trial.\nDespite differences in nutrient composition, acute consumption of grass-finished beef, a plant-based meat alternative, and grain-finished beef did not elicit significantly different postprandial inflammatory responses. These findings suggest that, in the short term, the choice between these protein sources may not meaningfully impact inflammation. Further research is needed to explore potential long-term health implications. Clinical trial registry\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Prediabetes, Diabetes and Folate Status among U.S. Women of Reproductive Age: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011-March 2020.\nDiabetes and prediabetes were common among WRA. Diabetes was associated with high RBC folate concentration and high MeFox despite low folic acid intake;  however, these associations were reduced among those with good glycemic control. Screening for and preventing the progression of prediabetes, diagnosis, and glycemic control among those with diabetes has the potential to prevent adverse outcomes.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Inflamm Bowel Dis\n    A Real-World Longitudinal Case-Study Implementing Digital Screening and Treatment for Distress in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: The COMPASS-IBD Patient Journey.\nRoutine mental health screening and COMPASS-IBD were successfully implemented in an outpatient IBD service, but support from trainee psychologists and the research team was required.

These observations underscore the potential role of tonsillectomy in influencing long-term gastrointestinal health, warranting further investigation into underlying mechanisms and preventative strategies.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx J Crohns Colitis\n    Clinical utility of pre-treatment 4-digit resolution HLA genotyping to guide anti-TNF choice and concomitant immunomodulator use.\n Pre-treatment 4-digit HLA testing informs anti-TNF treatment choice and immunomodulator use. In HLA-DQA1*05 01 carriers, adalimumab monotherapy should be used and infliximab avoided. In HLA-DQA1*05 05 carriers, infliximab or adalimumab can be used with a concomitant immunomodulator. In patients who do not carry either HLA-DQA1*05 01 or HLA-DQA1*05 05, adalimumab monotherapy or infliximab with a concomitant immunomodulator are recommended.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Learning Curve in Intestinal Ultrasound: Advancing from Basic Skills to Advanced Competencies-Insights from the IUS IG-IBD Master Program.\n This study establishes the first comprehensive, parameter-specific learning thresholds for IUS competency in IBD. Our findings demonstrate that structured training enables basic IUS proficiency within 75-112 examinations for experienced ultrasonographers, while advanced skills require extended practice. These data represent an important step toward defining evidence-based benchmarks for IUS training, supporting the development of standardized international curricula and safe clinical implementation.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Risk of adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes after open versus laparoscopic surgery for IBD: a nationwide cohort study.\n Prior surgery for IBD is associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes. A laparoscopic approach does not mitigate these risks.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Pancreas\n    Genetic and Electrophysiological Characterization of Acute Recurrent Pancreatitis in Israeli Patients.\nMore than half of acute recurrent pancreatitis cases had a genetic basis, presenting at a younger age. CFTR variants were the most prevalent. The high prevalence of the PRSS1 p.Lys23Arg variant among Jewish Georgian individuals suggests a potential founder effect. These findings highlight the importance of genetic evaluation in the diagnosis and management of acute recurrent pancreatitis.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Impact of Splanchnic Vein Thrombosis on Outcomes of Interventions in Patients With Pancreatic Fluid Collections Following Acute Pancreatitis- A Prospective Observational Study.\nSVT was not associated with increased complications, bleeding risk, or mortality following interventions for symptomatic PFCs in AP.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Pancreatology\n    Analgesic phenotypes in acute pancreatitis: Clustering analysis of two prospective global cohort studies.\n Unique clusters in the management of pain in AP were identified, with associations to severity of AP. Substantial centre-level variations exist in the patterns of analgesic prescribing globally, contributing to variations in outcomes.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Elevated circulating glycine levels are associated with reduced pancreatic cancer risk: A prospective cohort study based on the UK biobank.\n Higher circulating glycine levels are associated with a reduced risk of PC, even in individuals with the highest genetic susceptibility. These findings suggest that higher circulating glycine levels may hold potential for PC prevention strategies, warranting further experimental validation of glycine supplementation in prospective trials.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \n\n\nReviews&Editorials\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\npublisher website using the provided link\n\n\n    Inflamm Bowel Dis\n    Hidden Clues in the Epithelial Brush Border: A New Prognostic Marker for Pediatric Crohn's Disease.\n\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Unmasking a New Trauma in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Unequal Psychological Burden.\nInflammatory bowel disease-related post-traumatic stress disproportionately affects Black and Latino/a patients and is driven by traumatic disease experiences, cumulative adversity, and unmeasured medication effects. Recognition of these factors and implementation of routine screening and trauma-informed care are essential to improve outcomes and reduce inequities in these patients.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx J Crohns Colitis\n    Pouch disorders: evidence, gaps, and next steps.\n\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Pancreatology\n    Positioning serum autoantibody signatures within the evolving landscape of early pancreatic cancer detection.\n\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \n\n\nMiscellaneous\nmisc publications eg case reports, tools of the trade, images of\nthe month, etc…\n\n\n    Inflamm Bowel Dis\n    Pregnancy and Maternal Outcomes After Exposure to Risankizumab During Pregnancy: A Multi-Center Experience in the United States.\n\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Safety of Risankizumab during Pregnancy in IBD.\n\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Liver Transpl\n    A new chapter for global progress: ILTS leadership on the future of liver transplantation.\n\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Twelve is the new fifteen: The evolving MELD paradigm.\n\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Pancreas\n    Impact of ERCP on Long-term Pain Medication Needs in Chronic Pancreatitis Patients: A Retrospective Cohort Study.\n\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Markers of Gut Inflammation in Pediatric Acute Pancreatitis.\n\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Pancreatology\n    Role of bioimpedance spectroscopy analysis to assess hydration status in the early phase of acute pancreatitis.\n\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \n\n\nLetters&Replies\nLetters to the editors and authors’ replies\n\n\n    Pancreatology\n    Response to the letter to the editor regarding our manuscript: \"Concealed pancreatic cancer in acute pancreatitis: Early MRCP and EUS surveillance improves prognosis and identifies high-risk patients\".\n\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Response to: \"Defining pancreas delayed graft function: Advancement or premature standardization?\"\n\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
