However, findings should be interpreted with caution due to moderate to low certainty of evidence and some concerns or high risk of bias in many cases.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Comment on \"Safety of Rotavirus Vaccination in Infants That Were Exposed to Biologics In Utero: A Systematic Review\".\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nComparative Efficacy of Medical Therapies in Reducing the Risk of Postoperative Recurrence in Crohn's Disease: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis.\r\n Anti-tumor necrosis factor agents, namely ADA and IFX, are the most effective treatments in reducing postoperative recurrence of CD, followed by VDZ. THPs and antibiotics ranked lower than biologics. Nonpharmacological interventions such as curcumin, vitamin D, and probiotics did not demonstrate efficacy in reducing postoperative recurrence.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut Mycobiome in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review of Case-Control Studies.\r\nThe mycobiome is altered in IBD, as differences in beta diversity were found between cases and controls consistently.

Despite this, they have lower inpatient mortality and better metabolic profiles. Early referral and specialized diagnostic techniques can improve staging and outcomes. As bariatric surgery is more often encountered, standardized clinical guidelines are needed.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOutcomes of FOLFIRINOX versus gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel in patients with early recurrent pancreatic cancer after adjuvant S-1 treatment: A propensity score-matched analysis.\r\nGnP was associated with improved OS compared to FOLFIRINOX for patients with early recurrence after adjuvant S-1.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nProteomic insights into chronic pancreatitis: Proteome-wide mendelian randomization to identify potential therapeutic targets.\r\nThis study prioritizes 26 proteins (tiers 1-3 targets) as potential therapeutic targets for CP, bridging proteomic insights to clinical translation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    In pursuit of perfection: a small but important refinement of the isotopic measurement of human milk output.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Letter to the Editor Regarding \"Real-World Comparison of Effectiveness, Treatment Persistence, and Safety of First-Line Advanced Therapies at 1 Year for Ulcerative Proctitis\".\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    Defining oligo-recurrence criteria for locoregional intervention in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: A multidisciplinary era perspective.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous\r\nmisc publications eg case reports, tools of the trade, images of\r\nthe month, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Reanalysis of the vitamin D and dementia association using the doubly-ranked nonlinear Mendelian randomization approach.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    The impact of frailty on liver transplant candidacy - A survey study on current clinical practices in the United States.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetters&Replies\r\nLetters to the editors and authors’ replies\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Establishing minimal reporting standards for unknown metabolites: an essential prerequisite for advancing nutritional metabolomics.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRevised analyses do not provide compelling evidence of any benefit of vitamin D.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
