This finding highlights the potential, especially for MRE and IUS to be widely utilized in managing IBD in both clinical practice and clinical trials.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Adipose tissue content of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids and all-cause mortality: a Danish prospective cohort study.\r\nAdipose tissue content of linoleic acid was inversely associated with all-cause mortality, whereas adipose tissue content of arachidonic acid was associated with a higher all-cause mortality.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nBioavailability and pharmacokinetics of (poly)phenols following consumption of selected blueberries and a blueberry-rich protein bar by adult males and females: a randomized, crossover, controlled trial.\r\n Differing berry (poly)phenol content and bioaccessibility only minimally affected bioavailability following consumption of blueberries relative to a blueberry-rich protein bar, suggesting (poly)phenol-dense foods, such as bars and snacks, could provide similar health benefits as raw fruits. Further studies using other crops are required to assess if these findings are translatable. Clinical trial registry NCT04175106 ( CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRY  NCT04175106 (\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCharacterization of iron status biomarkers and hematological indices among young adults of East Asian or Northern European ancestry: A cross-sectional analysis from the Iron Genes in East Asian and Northern European Adults Study (FeGenes).\r\nIndividuals of EA ancestry had a significantly greater body Fe burden compared to NE individuals. Of concern, these differences were evident in a cohort primarily consisting of young individuals aged 18-29 y.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDifferences in nonheme iron absorption between healthy adults of East Asian or Northern European ancestry from the Iron Genes in East Asian and Northern European Adults Study (FeGenes): A cross-sectional stable iron isotope study.\r\nEA individuals have a greater SF-corrected Fe absorption compared with NE individuals. Increased Fe absorption and resulting excess Fe accumulation suggests that EA individuals may be at greater risk of Fe overload-related diseases. Further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term implications of these findings.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEfficacy of a 24-month behavioral intervention focused on sugary beverage reduction for Latino mother-infant dyads: evidence from a randomized controlled trial.\r\nThis intervention, combined with home delivery of bottled water, was effective in reducing sugar consumption from beverages for Latina mothers by roughly 8 g/day in the first year after childbirth. However, this effect was not maintained and was not significant for infants. More comprehensive and sustained strategies are likely needed to maintain efficacy and improve outcomes related to weight or body composition, particularly for infants.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIron regulatory hormones and their associations with iron status biomarkers among healthy adults of East Asian or Northern European ancestry: A cross-sectional comparison from the Iron Genes in East Asian and Northern European Adults Study (FeGenes).\r\nA lower hepcidin SF ratio in EA compared with NE participants suggests that among EAs, hepcidin concentrations are lower relative to the load of Fe present. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the observed differences. This study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT04198545.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLongitudinal cohort study of canola composition demonstrates changes in the climate and the food system are decreasing the essential fatty acid content of canola.\r\n Compared our observations to publicly available food composition databases, the observed systemic changes in fatty acid composition from the field can be detected on grocery store shelves.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMaternal Macronutrient Intake at Pregnancy and Offspring Growth Trajectory through Childhood: A Prospective Analysis in the Growing Up Today Study 2 Cohort. \r\nOther macronutrients from various food sources were not associated with the offspring weight. Overall, these data suggest that, apart from trans fatty acids, other macronutrient composition of maternal diet may have minimal impact on offspring body weight in this well-nourished population.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRelationship between gestational weight gain with fetal body composition and organ volumes in the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Fetal Dimensional Study: a prospective pregnancy cohort.\r\nExcessive GWG was associated with greater fetal size primarily manifested by a pattern of fat accumulation across the fetal arm and abdomen. Future studies should examine whether these fetal changes have functional implications for childhood adiposity and metabolic dysfunction.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nUnveiling Sub-group Trends of Stunting and Wasting in Indian Children: A Serial Cross-sectional Analysis from National Family Health Surveys 3-5.\r\nAlthough there have been significant reductions in disparities by wealth in mean HAZ and WHZ scores in India, persistent disparities by caste, tribe, and area of residence necessitate reinvestments in targeted interventions. Further, despite this narrowing of disparities and overall progress against stunting, anthropometric scores in early childhood continue to be low in India, especially with regard to wasting, indicating the importance of not only maternal nutrition and care for newborns, but more comprehensive efforts to address poverty and other factors that contribute to undernutrition, with a focus on vulnerable populations.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Generalizability of Randomized Controlled Trials to Routine Clinical Care in Ulcerative Colitis.\r\nHalf of patients with UC starting advanced therapy in routine care may be eligible for participation in phase 3 RCTs. Disease activity is the primary reason for trial exclusion.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Consequences of Preterm Birth in the Children of Mothers with Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Nationwide Cohort Study. \r\nWe also found a non-significantly increased risk of epilepsy (1.11;  0.51-2.42), chronic lung disease and asthma (1.10;  0.76-1.60), schizophrenia/psychosis (1.17;  0.50-2.73), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder 1.15 (0.83-1.60). Our study indicates the possibility of chronic health consequences in children born preterm to mothers with IBD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nWinnie Mice: A Chronic and Progressive Model of Ulcerative Colitis.\r\nWhile Winnie mice are currently less studied compared to other more established models of colitis, much has been discovered in the initial years of its use as a UC-like model. In summary, the use of Winnie mice adds to the growing armamentarium that is required to develop precision-based medicine for its future application in treating complex multifactorial diseases, such as UC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    A pro-inflammatory diet is associated with growth and virulence of Escherichia coli in pediatric Crohn's disease. \r\nA negative association between metabolites of fatty acid metabolism and HEI was found. In total, our results suggest that a pro-inflammatory diet may potentiate hallmarks of the inflammation-associated dysbiosis in CD and highlight the need for microbiome-targeted dietary interventions optimizing the anti-inflammatory potential of habitual diet in the management of pediatric CD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCombination of white-light imaging based and narrow-band imaging based artificial intelligence models during colonoscopy in patients with ulcerative colitis. \r\nThe sequential use of WLI and NBI AI models can provide better stratification of relapse risk compared with using either model alone, offering a more accurate and personalized approach to treatment intensification. This dual-model AI approach aligns with the T2T approach in UC management.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJanus kinase inhibitors in the management of acute severe ulcerative colitis: a comprehensive review. \r\nJAKi seem to be a promising treatment option for ASUC, with both tofacitinib and upadacitinib achieving colectomy-free rates of approximately 80%. Further studies are essential to define whether JAKi can replace cyclosporine/infliximab as second line therapy for the medical management of ASUC, or whether they can even be used as initial treatment in place of intravenous corticosteroids.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLysophosphatidylcholine-Induced Aberrant Adipogenesis in Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Impaired Antibacterial Function in Adipocytes of Creeping Fat. \r\nThese findings were consistent in the TNBS-treated mouse model, where increased LPC levels in the blood, and a significant reduction in SAA½-positive adipocytes were noted. LPC-induced aberrant adipogenesis in CF is a newly identified pathological feature in CD patients and a potential therapeutic target.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMachine learning and metabolomics identify biomarkers associated with the disease extent of ulcerative colitis. \r\nThe serum level of asparaginyl valine in patients with rectal UC was significantly lower than that in E2 and E3 groups. Our findings revealed the metabolic landscape of UC and identified biomarkers for different disease extents, confirming the value of metabolites in predicting the occurrence and progression of UC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNon-Conventional Dysplasia in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Colorectal Adenocarcinoma: A Case-Cohort Study. \r\nBoth conventional and NC lesions seem to be associated with increased risk of CRC. Conventional lesions are more strongly associated with CRC than NC lesions in the post-HD era, but misclassifications in the pre-HD era may have resulted in a biased increased risk estimate for NC lesions.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    Evaluating allograft risk models in organ transplantation: Understanding and balancing model discrimination and calibration.\r\nOur goal in this perspective is to offer advice to transplant professionals about how to evaluate a prediction model, focusing on the key aspects of discrimination and calibration. We use liver allograft assessment as a paradigm example, but the lessons pertain to other scenarios too.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    Contrast agent dispersion visualized by CE-EUS may be a prediction tool for FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy effectiveness in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. \r\nThe elastography strain ratio was higher in the effectively treated group (20.9 vs 13.6, p = 0.138). This proof-of-concept study showed that the dispersion parameter of the first wave of contrast was 2.5 times higher in patients in whom FOLFIRINOX was effective, suggesting that this parameter could possibly be a reliable prediction tool.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEffect of plasmapheresis versus standard medical treatment in patients with hypertriglyceridemia-associated acute pancreatitis complicated by early organ failure (PERFORM-R): Study design and rationale of a multicenter, pragmatic, registry-based randomized controlled trial.\r\n This trial will provide top-class evidence regarding the clinical impact of plasmapheresis in HTG-AP patients with early organ failure. The findings of this trial will have a direct influence on the current clinical practice concerning the management of HTG-AP.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFocal pancreatic parenchymal atrophy could be a precursor of pancreatic cancer. \r\nThe interval between FPPA recognition and PDAC diagnosis was 35.33 months, which was significantly shorter in the surgical group. FPPA could be a precursor of PDAC and suggest the area at risk of PDAC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe efficacy and safety profile of third-line treatment in patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. \r\n43 of 77 patients (56 %) experienced at least one grade 3 or 4 toxicity. In real-world settings, patients with mPDAC receiving third-line chemotherapy may have a moderate survival advantage, although clinicians should carefully select patients owing to high incidence of grade ¾ toxicities.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    One piece of the puzzle: understanding gestational weight gain and its role in maternal, fetal, and newborn outcomes.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nWarming plants and cooling essential fatty acids. \r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Decoding the proteomic landscape of inflammatory bowel disease.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe power of real-world data: insights into incident IBD populations in the modern era.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    When does delay in treatment impact survival from pancreatic cancer?\r\nThere are also delays in establishing the diagnosis and delays in accessing treatment services after diagnosis. All three delays have prognostic implications and need to be considered in addressing the global problem of inequitable access to health care.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous\r\nmisc publications eg case reports, tools of the trade, images of\r\nthe month, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    This is the moment: advancing Food is Medicine through research. \r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Intestinal Ultrasound Identified Crohn's Disease In Previously Undiagnosed Siblings. \r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nResting-State Functional Connectivity of the Cerebellum Differs Between Persons With Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Healthy Controls in Relation to Executive Function. \r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    After the curtain was raised, Hepatitis C plays on: Celebrities and Hepatitis C.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFellows' Corner.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFrom core to surface: Expanding the donor pool with Hepatitis B Surface antigen positive liver allografts.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLetter to the Editor: Monoacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 in fatty liver ischemia-reperfusion injury: Exacerbation or mitigation? \r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetters&Replies\r\nLetters to the editors and authors’ replies\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Limitations of the indicator amino acid oxidation method for determining amino acid requirements.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    Beyond 4 weeks?

These new techniques can help expand the donor pool with similar or even better post-LT outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Breastfeeding and infant growth in relation to childhood overweight - A longitudinal cohort study.\r\nLonger duration of exclusive breastfeeding was associated with decreased risk of being overweight, while accelerated infant growth was associated with increased risk. Children with accelerated infant growth who were never breastfed had the highest risk of overweight at 5-9 years of age, while there was no association if the infants were exclusively breastfed >4 months.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCharacterization of gene-environment interactions for vitamin D through variance quantitative trait loci: a UK Biobank-based genetic epidemiology study.\r\nThrough the lens of vQTLs, we identified additional gene-environment interactions affecting vitamin D status in addition to season of measurement. These findings may provide new insights into the etiology of vitamin D deficiency and encourage personalized prevention and management of associated diseases for at-risk individuals.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nConsuming Pecans as a Snack Improves Lipids/Lipoproteins and Diet Quality Compared to Usual Diet in Adults at Increased Risk for Cardiometabolic Diseases: A Randomized Controlled Trial. \r\nclinicaltrials. gov NCT05071807.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDescribing the landscape of nutrition- and diet-related randomized controlled trials: meta-research study of protocols published between 2012 and 2022.\r\nThe number of protocols for nutrition- or diet-related RCTs published is increasing, supporting the raising awareness and the importance of promoting these publications. The support and mention of relevant reporting guidelines by journals and researchers, respectively, remain far from ideal.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPlanetary Health Diet Index in relation to mortality in a prospective cohort study of U.S. Black females.\r\nAdherence to a diet that has been shown to benefit the planet was associated with a lower risk of mortality among Black females, primarily driven by reduction in CVD-specific mortality risk.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nProtein glycation compromises the bioavailability of milk protein-derived lysine in vivo in healthy adult males: a double-blind randomized cross-over trial. \r\nA high level of milk protein glycation strongly reduces post-prandial plasma lysine availability in vivo in humans. Industrial processing and storage of (milk) protein products can strongly modulate protein bioavailability and, as such, lower the nutritional value of a protein source.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nWhole cranberry fruit powder supplement reduces the incidence of culture-confirmed urinary tract infections in females with a history of recurrent urinary tract infection: A 6-month multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.\r\n This study showed that whole cranberry powder capsules do not impact safety markers and reduce the incidence of culture-confirmed UTI and several other UTI-related outcomes in healthy females with rUTI history. Clinical trials registration Registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03042273).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Circulating and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Biomarkers of Intestinal Fibrosis in Small Bowel Crohn's Disease.\r\nClinically available and exploratory circulating and MRI biomarkers are associated with the degree of inflammation versus fibrosis in CD ileal resections. With further validation, these biomarkers may be used to guide medical and surgical decision-making for refractory CD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflammation-Induced Th17 Cells Synergize with the Inflammation-Trained Microbiota to Mediate Host Resiliency Against Intestinal Injury. \r\nFecal microbiota transfer showed that the inflammation-trained microbiota was necessary for protection, likely by maintaining protective Th17 cells in situ. Inflammation can generate protective Th17 cells that synergize with the inflammation-trained microbiota to provide host resiliency against subsequent injury, indicating that inflammation-induced Th17 TRM T cells are heterogenous and contain protective subsets.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSafety and Efficacy of Fecal Microbiota, Live-jslm (REBYOTA®), for the Prevention of Recurrent Clostridioides difficile Infection in Participants With Inflammatory Bowel Disease in PUNCH CD3-OLS.\r\nThe results of this subgroup analysis of PUNCH CD3-OLS suggest RBL is safe and efficacious in patients with IBD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSerum Periostin is Able to Stratify Type 2-Dominant Ulcerative Colitis.\r\nPeriostin can be a useful biomarker to stratify type 2-dominant UC patients, thereby predicting the efficacy of oral prednisolone. Moreover, periostin plays an important role in the setting of type 2-dominant UC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    A pro-inflammatory diet is associated with growth and virulence of Escherichia coli in pediatric Crohn's disease. \r\nA negative association between metabolites of fatty acid metabolism and HEI was found.

All had moderate sensitivity to indicate surgery, and al missed similar numbers of malignant lesions. Performing EUS-FNA before application of guidelines seems appropriate to guide further management of asymptomatic PLs, preventing unnecessary surgery and referring patients appropriately for surveillance. The ESG-2018 guideline proved most accurate for this purpose.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeta-analysis\r\nmeta-analyses and systematic reviews\r\n\r\n\r\n    J Crohns Colitis\r\n    Systematic Review on definitions of Intestinal Ultrasound Treatment Response and Remission in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\nThis systematic review reveals significant variability in IUS definitions of response and remission in IBD, highlighting the need to standardize eligibility criteria and outcome measures for IUS in IBD clinical trials.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Coffee Consumption, Additive Use, and Risk of Type 2 Diabetes- Results from Three Large Prospective US Cohort Studies.\r\nAdding sugar or artificial sweetener significantly attenuated the magnitude of the inverse association between higher coffee consumption and T2D risk, whereas the use of cream did not alter the inverse association.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut microbiota may modify the association between dietary polyphenol intake and circulating levels of hippuric acid: results from a 1-year longitudinal study in China.\r\nThe gut microbial genera that predicted circulating HA levels may modify the association between dietary polyphenol intake and circulating HA levels, and elevated serum HA concentrations are favorably associated with multiple cardiometabolic risk markers.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Disease-State Dependent Associations Between Intrinsic Brain Function and Symptoms of Fatigue, Depression, and Anxiety in Crohn's Disease.\r\nIntrinsic brain function in patients with CD varies by disease state, with prominent frontal cortex changes in active disease. These brain activity changes are at least partly related to the magnitude of neuropsychiatric symptoms and highlight a role of disturbed brain-gut interactions in the development of EIS especially in rCD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEffectiveness and Safety of Adalimumab in Patients With Very Early-Onset Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Retrospective Study on Behalf of the Porto Inflammatory Bowel Disease Working Group of European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition.\r\n Adalimumab therapy is a viable therapeutic option in patients with VEO-IBD with an acceptable safety profile.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nExpression Profile of MicroRNAs in Breast Milk of Women With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Correlation With Disease Activity and Medical Treatments.\r\nThis study highlights that miRNAs in breast milk are differentially expressed in mothers with IBD, influenced by the disease and its treatments. These findings emphasize the impact of maternal health on milk composition and potential implications for infant immune development. Understanding these findings may guide personalized treatment strategies for mothers and promote breastfeeding among mothers with IBD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Assessment and Reporting of Extraintestinal Manifestations and Fatigue in Phase 3 Inflammatory Bowel Disease Clinical Trials.\r\nEIM and fatigue data is inconsistently collected in RCTs of IBD. Standardizing collection methods across RCTs would provide greater insight on these agents and their efficacy in treating these manifestations of disease.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGSDMB modulates intestinal epithelial homeostasis via regulating hyperactive unfolded protein response in Crohn's disease.\r\n We have uncovered an important and a previously unrecognized role of GSDMB in intestinal homeostasis, which represents a potential therapeutic target for intestinal inflammation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSevere obesity, a susceptibility factor for developing inflammatory bowel disease. Results of a population-based study.\r\n Severe obesity and BS were independent risk factors for the development of IBD. Non-invasive screening for IBD seems to be warranted in this population.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Impact of Advanced Medical Therapies on Time to Resection and Colorectal Cancer Outcomes in Ulcerative Colitis Patients Undergoing Colectomy. \r\nAdvanced therapy patients had higher incidental cancers rates, associated with decreased CRC-survival.

Future research should investigate the impact of these differences in fatty acid status on infant health outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDietary-Lifestyle Patterns and Colorectal Cancer Risk: Global Cancer Update Programme (CUP Global) Systematic Literature Review.\r\nAdopting a healthy pattern of diet, maintaining a healthy weight, staying physically active, and embracing health-conscious habits, such as avoiding tobacco and moderating alcohol, are collectively associated with a lower CRC risk. Healthy lifestyle habits are key to primary CRC prevention.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDrivers of stunting and wasting across serial cross-sectional household surveys of children under 2 years of age in Pakistan: potential contribution of ecological factors.\r\nApart from recognized multifactorial drivers of stunting and wasting among children such as poverty, food insecurity and maternal undernutrition, our analysis suggest the potential independent association with climatic factors such as heat and excess precipitation over time. These findings underscore the need for further research and potential integration of climatic mitigation and adaptation with nutrition response strategies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEarly identification of potentially reversible cancer cachexia using explainable machine learning driven by body weight dynamics: a multicenter cohort study.\r\nThis study presents an explainable ML model for the early identification of PRCC that utilizes simple body weight dynamics. The findings showcase the potential of this approach in improving the management of cancer cachexia to optimize patient outcomes. Registration information Data described in the manuscript was derived from a registered research project (URL  ID  ChiCTR1800020329).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInvestigating eating architecture and the impact of the precision of recorded eating time: a cross-sectional study.\r\nPrecise timing improves the estimation of eating architecture. Differences in estimation will affect descriptions of children's eating habits and possibly dietary guidance. However, consistent directional associations across timing methods, suggest that broad times could provide a pragmatic method for investigating eating architecture associations in large samples.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLignan Intake and Mortality Among Adults with Incident Type 2 Diabetes-Prospective Cohort Studies.\r\nAmong individuals with T2D, a higher intake of lignans, particularly SECO, was significantly associated with reduced overall, CVD, and cancer mortality. Minority groups may particularly benefit from lignan intake, although further studies are warranted to substantiate this observation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPlanetary Health Diet Index Trends and Associations with Dietary Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Disease Biomarkers, Obesity, and Mortality in the United States (2005-2018).\r\nThese results underscore the potential health and greenhouse gas emission benefits aligned with the planetary health diet.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPlasma metabolomic signature of a proinflammatory diet in relation to breast cancer risk: a prospective cohort study.\r\n We identified a metabolic signature that reflects a proinflammatory diet and is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nProtein supplementation delivered alone or in combination with presumptive azithromycin treatment for enteric pathogens did not improve linear growth in Bangladeshi infants: results of a cluster-randomized controlled trial.\r\nSupplementation to increase intakes of high-quality protein, provided with or without presumptive treatment for enteric pathogens, did not improve linear growth from 6 to 12 months of age.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Clonal Hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential in Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis.\r\nOur findings underscore a connection between IBD and CHIP pathophysiology. Patients with IBD and CHIP had unique risk profiles, especially among older UC patients and younger CD patients. These findings suggest distinct evolutionary pathways for CHIP in IBD and necessitate awareness among IBD providers and hematologists to identify patients potentially at risk for CHIP-related complications including malignancy, cardiovascular disease, and acceleration of their inflammatory disease.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImpact of 5-Aminosalicylic Acid on Ustekinumab in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Retrospective Medical Claims Analysis.\r\n5-ASA did not provide a significant overall benefit when used in combination with UST for CD or UC. However, post hoc subgroup analyses indicated a potential role for 5-ASA in specific subgroups. Further studies are necessary to confirm these findings and explore personalized treatment strategies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Correlation Between Fecal Amino Acids, Colonic Mucosal Taste Receptors, and Clinical Features and Indicators of Ulcerative Colitis: A Multicenter Exploratory Study.\r\nThe increased levels of taste receptors and fecal AAs in the colon of UC patients suggest an abnormal nutrient-sensing mechanism, potentially playing a crucial role in the development of the disease.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nWound Healing After Vaginal Delivery, Episiotomy, and Cesarean Section Delivery Among Women With IBD: Results From the PIANO Registry.\r\nEpisiotomy was a common occurrence in patients with IBD. Immunomodulator, but not biologic, use was found to be associated with delayed wound healing. This association could reflect a direct medication effect on episiotomy wound healing or inadequate treatment of underlying active disease prior to delivery. Vaginal tears were also common but delayed wound healing was not associated with IBD therapy. C-section occurred at high rates, particularly in Crohn's disease patients, with no reported delays in postpartum wound healing.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nhsa_circ_0015388 Reduces Macrophage Derived Reactive Oxygen Species in Crohn's Disease.\r\n A comprehensive analysis of circRNA expression revealed that 31 circRNAs were dysregulated in the CD group. Hsa_circ_0015388 is expressed in macrophages and negatively regulates ROS function inhibiting the TNFSF10 pathway. This study first revealed that hsa_circ_0015388 plays a role in the pathogenesis of CD by suppressing ROS production in macrophages.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Childhood-onset inflammatory bowel disease and chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis: A Swedish nationwide cohort study 2002-2022.\r\nWe found a six-fold increased risk of CNO in childhood-onset IBD compared to non-IBD comparators. Patients with IBD+CNO are characterized by younger age at IBD onset, more frequent extraintestinal manifestations, and higher usage of biologics.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDeconditioning in quiescent Crohn's Disease patients with heightened fatigue perception.\r\n CD self-reported increased fatigue perception and exhibited a slower rate of post-exercise PCr resynthesis compared to HV. This occurred independently of changes in body composition, muscle strength and fatigueability. IBD fatigue may be linked to peripheral muscle deconditioning and lower gmCBF during submaximal exercise.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDurable remission after ileocolic resection for Crohn's disease is achievable in selected patients. Long-term results of a prospective multicentric cohort study of the GETAID Chirurgie.\r\nSurgery for CD achieved durable remission in 20%, rising to 40% in those with a B1 phenotype. These results support surgery as a viable alternative to medical treatment, offering treatment-free durable remission and preserving medical treatment options.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImprovement in Serum Eosinophilia is Observed in Clinical Responders to Ustekinumab but not Adalimumab in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\n Eosinophil reduction was identified as a marker for early response to ustekinumab in both UC and CD, but not adalimumab. No difference was observed among UC patients treated with vedolizumab either. Targeting the IL-12/IL-23 pathway may be more effective in managing eosinophil-associated inflammation in IBD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRadiation exposure in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. \r\nUp to 5.5% of IBD patients reached a CED ≥75mSv. While most imaging decisions were deemed appropriate, caution against excessive radiation remains crucial.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRisankizumab Efficacy and Safety Based on Prior Inadequate Response or Intolerance to Advanced Therapy: Post Hoc Analysis of the INSPIRE and COMMAND Phase 3 Studies.\r\n Risankizumab was effective and well tolerated, regardless of prior AT-IR status.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    Racial and ethnic disparities in liver transplant access vary within and across transplant referral regions.\r\n We observed substantial geographic variation in the magnitude of racial disparities in liver transplant access across the United States. Findings highlight the need for targeted health equity interventions in regions with high disparities and the development of disparity-sensitive access metrics for transplant centers.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nValidation of mitochondrial FMN as a predictor for early allograft dysfunction and patient survival measured during hypothermic oxygenated perfusion.\r\nLow-risk grafts, according to FMN, display a negligible risk for patients. Yet, high-risk grafts are associated with increased risk for EAD, transplantation, and early mortality and should not be used for transplantation without further assessment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    Sequence analysis of the 5' region of the chymotrypsin C (CTRC) gene in chronic pancreatitis. \r\nHowever, the disease association was driven by the linkage disequilibrium with the known CTRC risk variant c.180C>T. We found no significant association between variants in the 5' region of the CTRC gene and CP risk.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Dietary patterns and omics: A meeting of two paradigm-shifting advances in nutrition science.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEfforts to reduce sugar-sweetened beverages and combat childhood obesity.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous\r\nmisc publications eg case reports, tools of the trade, images of\r\nthe month, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Inflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Postpartum Wound Healing for Mothers with Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Cause for Worry?
