Prior nonmedical adverse life events may be risk factors for the development of IBD-PTS. Additional research is warranted.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Bowel Wall Thickness Cutoff Value for Assessing Inflammatory Bowel Disease Activity Using Intestinal Ultrasonography in Children.\nAlthough IUS is an excellent tool for detecting moderate/severe bowel inflammation, this method showed limited accuracy in children <6 years old. The adult BWT cutoff missed over 30% of bowel inflammation in children. BWT cutoff of 0.27-0.30 cm in boys and 0.23-0.25 cm in girls and/or children <40 kg indicated active gut inflammation.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Characterization of Computed Tomography Colonography Findings of Ulcerative Colitis-Associated Neoplasia.\nand relevance Despite preoperative awareness of UCAN, CTC demonstrated limited sensitivity. While CTC may serve a complementary role in selected cases, endoscopy remains essential for comprehensive lesion detection.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Real-World Outcomes of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonist Therapy in Obese Patients With Ulcerative Colitis and IPAA With a History of Pouchitis.\n Our study in a small cohort of patients with UC-IPAA and obesity with a history of pouchitis showed that GLP-1RA use was associated with decreased risk of recurrent pouchitis and anti-diarrheal medication use.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Thromboembolic Risk in Ulcerative Colitis Patients on Advanced Therapy: A Real-World Data Analysis.\nVedolizumab demonstrated a favorable thromboembolic and cardiovascular safety profile compared with TNF inhibitors, whereas tofacitinib did not increase the risk at either dose. Concomitant 5-aminosalicylic acid may have a preventive effect against VTE. These findings may aid therapeutic decision-making for UC patients with elevated thrombotic risk.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Trends in Use of Prescribed Opioids in Incident and Prevalent Patients With Ulcerative Colitis: A Nationwide Study in Sweden. \nIn this nationwide register-based study, adults with UC had higher prescribed opioid use within two years before and up to five years after first UC diagnosis compared with reference individuals. However, adults with prevalent UC (and reference individuals) had a declining temporal opioid use trend during 2006-2022.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx J Crohns Colitis\n    Efficacy and Safety of Risankizumab in Patients with Moderately to Severely Active Crohn's Disease: Interim Results from the SEQUENCE Open-Label Extension Study.\nThis interim analysis of continuous open-label risankizumab therapy showed durable long-term clinical efficacy and no new safety signals in patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease.
