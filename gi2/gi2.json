Compounding this is that residents consume much less than what is provided and do not meet the recommendations for dietary fibre consumption. There is scope to improve dietary fibre provision, promote consumption to residents to aid laxation and potentially reduce laxative use and the unwanted side effect of diarrhoea.

Results suggest a cumulative effect of the adverse experiences resulting in a dietary pattern higher in energy-dense foods. Children with ACEs reported under the dimension of \"abuse\" seemed to have a reduced food consumption.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCross-sectional associations of WIC benefit redemption and diet among children ages 1-4 years in California.\r\nHigher redemption was associated with higher child intake of select WIC foods. Pairing the promotion of benefit redemption among program participants with nutrition education efforts may enhance dietary impacts of WIC participation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDevelopment of a national database for dietary glycemic index and load for nutritional epidemiologic studies in the United States.\r\n We developed a national GI and GL database to facilitate large-scale and high-quality surveillance or cohort studies of diet and health outcomes in the US.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFasting and postprandial plasma metabolite responses to a 12-week dietary intervention in tissue-specific insulin resistance: a secondary analysis of the PERSON randomized trial.\r\nDiet effects on plasma metabolite profiles were more pronounced than phenotype-diet interactions. A LFHP diet may be more effective than a HMUFA diet for reducing cardiometabolic risk in individuals with tissue-specific IR, irrespective of IR phenotype.

In particular, the correlation between baseline serum levels of IL-23 and mucosal healing at 48 weeks is particularly strong, paving the way for its use to drive therapeutic decisions.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPostoperative Crohn's Disease Recurrence Risk and Optimal Biologic Timing After Temporary Diversion Following Ileocolic Resection.\r\nDiversion of an ileocolic resection is not consistently associated with a risk of postoperative recurrence and should be performed when clinically appropriate. Patients requiring diversion at time of ileocolic resection are at high risk for recurrence, and biologic initiation prior to stoma reversal may be considered.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nResidual Disease Burden Among European Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Real-World Survey.\r\nPatients with IBD, both in remission and not in remission, experience residual symptoms that impair HRQoL. Comprehensive endpoints, incorporating HRQoL and patients' perspectives, and improved treatments are needed to address residual disease and patients' needs.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTarget Trial Emulation: Improving the Quality of Observational Studies in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Using the Principles of Randomized Trials.\r\n from observational data with some that focus on study design and others on statistical techniques. Target trial emulation is an emerging methodological process that aims to bridge this gap and improve the quality of observational studies by applying the principles of an ideal, or \"target,\" randomized trial to routinely collected clinical data. There has been a rapid expansion of observational studies that have emulated trials over the past 5 years in other medical fields, but this has yet to be adopted in gastroenterology and IBD. The wealth of nonrandomized clinical data available through electronic health records, patient registries, and administrative health databases afford innumerable hypothesis-generating opportunities for IBD research. This review outlines the principles of target trial emulation, discusses the merits to IBD observational studies in reducing the most common biases and improving confidence in causality, and details the caveats of using this approach.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Adaptive steroid tapering impedes corticosteroid-free remissions compared to forced tapering in clinical trials of ulcerative colitis.\r\nAmong patients with UC on corticosteroids in clinical trials, patients using adaptive steroid weaning regimens were less likely to achieve corticosteroid-free CR at one year but more likely to achieve CR at one year. Consideration should be given to implementing mandatory fixed steroid weaning protocols in future clinical trials of UC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEarly and Sustained Symptom Control with Mirikizumab in Patients with Ulcerative Colitis in the Phase 3 LUCENT Program.\r\nMirikizumab demonstrated efficacy in achieving and sustaining symptom control and comprehensive symptom control over 52 weeks. [NCT03518086;  NCT03524092].\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSerum Metabolites Relate to Mucosal and Transmural Inflammation in Pediatric Crohn Disease.\r\nWe extend on recent studies, observing differences in serum metabolite between healthy controls and Crohn disease patients, and suggest various associations of serum metabolites with transmural and mucosal inflammation. These metabolites could improve the understanding of pCD pathogenesis and assess disease severity.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    Association of psychosocial risk factors and liver transplant evaluation outcomes in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.\r\nNevertheless, increasing SIPAT score was associated with waitlist outcome. Our suggested SIPAT cut-off of ≥12 for MASLD patients warrants further external validation using data from other centers.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatic improvement within 27 days of avenciguat treatment in Child-Pugh a cirrhosis detected by an oral cholate challenge test.\r\nThe results support further study of avenciguat in treating portal hypertension and spotlight the utility of HepQuant DuO in the development of drug therapy for liver disease. HepQuant DuO facilitates use of function testing to measure hepatic improvement in clinical trials and the clinic.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIndocyanine green fluorescence quantification during normothermic ex situ perfusion for the assessment of porcine liver grafts after circulatory death.\r\nFurthermore, thrombolytic intervention using tissue plasminogen activator in DCD120 resulted in noteworthy outcomes, including significantly reduced ALP levels (p = 0.04) and improved ICG clearance (p = 0.02) with a trend towards mitigating fibrin deposition similar to DCD60, as well as enhancements in bile production (p = 0.09). In conclusion, ICG fluorescence imaging during normothermic ex situ liver perfusion provides real-time classification of hepatic vascular and biliary injuries, offering valuable insights for the more accurate selection and postintervention evaluation of marginal livers in transplantation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRecurrence of autoimmune liver diseases after liver transplantation: Review and expert opinion statement.\r\n Recurrent disease for AILD is associated with worse graft and patient survival. AIH patients could be considered for long-term low-dose predniso(lo)ne, whereas PBC patients should be placed on preventive UDCA after LT. There are no specific treatments for PSC recurrence;  however, adequate control of inflammatory bowel disease and optimal immunosuppression to avoid T-cell-mediated rejection should be encouraged.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    Impact of endoscopic ultrasound-guided tissue acquisition on prognosis and peritoneal lavage cytology in resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.\r\nEUS-TA had no negative impact on postoperative survival and PLC-positive rates in R/BR PDAC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSLC7A11 and the glutathione pathway as novel prognostic markers in resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: A metabolomics study of clinical specimens.\r\n Glutathione disulfide levels were significantly increased in clinical PDAC metabolomics. Additionally, increased mRNA and protein expression in SLC7A11 was observed in PDAC. Furthermore, the SLC7A11 isoform abundance ratio may be a valuable prognostic marker in patients with resectable PDAC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nZFHX3 methylation in peripheral blood monocytes as a potential biomarker for pancreatic cancer detection.\r\n Our study preliminarily suggests that ZFHX3 methylation combined with CA19-9 can improve the detection rate of PDAC. Especially in patients with normal CA19-9, ZFHX3 methylation can maintain stable diagnostic efficacy. The diagnostic value of ZFHX3 methylation still needs to be prospectively validated.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous\r\nmisc publications eg case reports, tools of the trade, images of\r\nthe month, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Inflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Surgery in Crohn's Disease: Past Performance Does Predict Future Results.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetters&Replies\r\nLetters to the editors and authors’ replies\r\n\r\n\r\n    Pancreatology\r\n    The timing of endoscopic necrosectomy: More questions than answers.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This was not explained by a lower diet quality contributed by UPF.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Anti-inflammatory Effects of Bacteroidota Strains Derived From Outstanding Donors of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation for the Treatment of Ulcerative Colitis.\r\nThis study demonstrated that A. putredinis, a representative Bacteroidota species, exhibits anti-inflammatory effects in vivo and in vitro;  however, the effects of other Bacteroidota species remain unexplored. Our fecal microbiota transplantation-based reverse translation approach using promising bacterial species may represent a breakthrough in microbiome drug development for controlling dysbiosis during ulcerative colitis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMRI and Blood-based Biomarkers Are Associated With Surgery in Children and Adults With Ileal Crohn's Disease.\r\n After accounting for clinical and MRI measures of severity, normalized 3D MTR and GM-CSF Ab are associated with the need for surgery in ileal CD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Associations between brain morphology, inflammatory markers and symptoms of fatigue, depression or anxiety in active and remitted Crohn's disease. \r\nReduced GMV in the precentral gyrus and other sensorimotor areas could reflect key contributions to fatigue pathophysiology in CD. A sensorimotor model of fatigue in CD could also pave the way for novel treatment approaches.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCyclophosphamide-free mobilisation increases safety while preserving the efficacy of autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in refractory Crohn's disease patients. \r\nCy-free mobilisation is safe and feasible in refractory CD patients undergoing AHSCT. Although relapse occurs in a significant proportion of patients, clinical and endoscopic responses are achieved upon CD-specific therapy reintroduction.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGenome-wide DNA methylome and transcriptome profiling reveals key genes involved in the dysregulation of adipose-stem cells in Crohn's disease.\r\n We identified a potential gene signature of CD in ASCs obtained from MAT. Integration analysis highlighted two novel genes demonstrating a negative correlation between promoter DNA methylation and transcription  one linked to ASCs in CD (MAB21L2) and the other (CACNA1H) related to disease remission.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInfluence of vitamin D receptor signaling and vitamin D on colonic epithelial cell fate decisions in ulcerative colitis.\r\nWe identified an important role of vitamin D signaling in supporting differentiated cell states in the human colonic epithelium, and thereby maintenance of the intestinal barrier integrity. This makes the vitamin D-VDR signaling axis an interesting target for therapeutic efforts to achieve and maintain remission in patients with UC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nManagement of colorectal neoplasia in IBD patients: current practice and future perspectives.\r\nWhile (sub)total and proctocolectomy play an important role in management of endoscopically unresectable CRN, partial colectomy may be considered in a subgroup of patients in endoscopic remission with limited disease extent without other CRN risk factors. High synchronous and metachronous CRN rates warrant careful mucosal visualization with shortened intervals for at least 5 years after treatment of CRN.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPan-enteric Crohn's capsule (Eliakim) score reliability and responsiveness to change in active Crohn's disease.\r\nES is a reliable scoring system in assessing pan-enteric mucosal inflammation in active CD, and might have a better responsiveness to clinical/biochemical change over time compared to LS.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRe-resection Rates and Disease Recurrence in Crohn's Disease - A Population-Based Study Using Individual-Level Patient Data.\r\n Re-resection rates, categorized by disease activity, are lower than those reported in other studies and are closely associated with disease phenotype and localization. Biological therapy may be disease-modifying for certain subgroups when initiated within one year of resection.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReal-world comparison of the effectiveness between ustekinumab and vedolizumab in patients with ulcerative colitis exposed to at least one anti-TNF agent.\r\n While no difference in terms of short-term clinical remission was observed, ustekinumab appears to be more effective than vedolizumab to induce endoscopic and histological remission at week 16 after failure of anti-TNFs in UC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    An updated analysis of retransplantation following living donor liver transplantation in the US: insights from the latest UNOS database.\r\n LDLT recipients had better GS in re-LT than DDLT.

The ethical application of LPE includes tailored patient education, assessment and disclosure of exchange balance, mitigation of risk and maximization of benefit for donors and recipients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nManagement of the high cardiac risk liver transplant candidate: multidisciplinary best practices and recommendations.\r\nIn this manuscript, we conduct a comprehensive review of the most recent evidence pertaining to the pre- and intra-operative management of these cardiac comorbidities in liver transplant candidates. Our aim is to provide recommendations that improve and standardize their clinical care.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRole of biomarkers in the diagnosis and management of HCC.\r\nIndeed, biomarker panels have shown promising data for HCC risk stratification and surveillance among patients with cirrhosis, as well as prognostication and detection of minimal residual disease in patients undergoing HCC treatment. Several large prospective studies to evaluate the role of these emerging biomarkers in clinical practice are currently ongoing.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe landscape of liver transplantation for patients with Alcohol-associated liver disease in USA.\r\nALD is a growing indication for liver transplantation. Although ALD patients continue to have excellent post-transplant outcomes and lower wait list mortality, candidates with ALD have higher adjusted transplant rates, and these differences have increased after AC implementation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreas\r\n    Genetic assessment of IPMN for predicting concomitant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.\r\n For selected IPMNs with non-intestinal, non-invasive, and branch duct, genetic assessment might be a helpful tool for predicting the possible development of concomitant PDAC, although a prospective validation study using a larger study population is needed.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatic body and tail adenocarcinoma: upfront resection versus neoadjuvant therapy, a contemporary analysis.\r\n No significant improvement in survival was demonstrated for patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic body or tail when compared to upfront resection. Considering the potential for disease progression given the more aggressive tumour biology of pancreatic body and tail adenocarcinomas, appropriate surgical candidates should be offered upfront resection to provide the best chance of survival and cure.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    Exploring the prognostic value of circular RNAs in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma using genome-wide expression profiling.\r\nWe identified several new circRNAs with biomarker potential in surgically treated PDAC, three of which showed an independent prognostic value. We also found that ciRS-7 is absent in cancer cells but abundant in tumor microenvironment and may hold potential as marker of activated stroma.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMorbidity and mortality in patients with stage IV pancreatic adenocarcinoma and acute cholangitis: Outcomes and risk prognostication.\r\nAC confers significant morbidity and mortality in advanced PDAC. Worse outcomes are associated with higher grade AC, primary tumor location in pancreatic body/tail, and metastases to liver and other sites.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Diet Management in Congenital Diarrheas and Enteropathies - General Concepts and Disease-Specific Approach, a Narrative Review.\r\nHowever, occasionally it allows parenteral nutrition weaning or reduction overtime mainly in enteroendocrine defects and rarely in epithelial trafficking and polarity defects.
