These findings suggest that recommendations based on NB (0.66g·kg -1 ·d -1 ) may underestimate protein needs for adequate health. Clinical trials registry # NCT02971046,\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    An Atlas Characterizing the Shared Genetic Architecture of Inflammatory Bowel Disease with Clinical and Behavioral Traits.\r\n The present analysis reveals the shared genetic architecture between multiple traits and IBD, CD, and UC. Understanding the relevance of joint occurrences of IBD with psychiatric diseases may moderate management of these diseases for individuals jointly affected by them.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClusters of Disease Activity and Early Risk Factors of Clinical Course of Pediatric Crohn's Disease.\r\nDuring the first 5 years of follow-up, one-third of children with CD experience a quiescent course. However, another one-third have a moderate-to-severe disease course. Surgery at the diagnosis is related to a quiescent course, while growth impairment and lack of response to induction therapy correlate with more severe disease activity during follow-up.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nProactive Infliximab Monitoring Improves the Rates of Transmural Remission in Crohn's Disease: A Propensity Score-Matched Analysis.\r\nProactive optimization of IFX based on trough levels increases the rates of transmural remission in CD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Crohn's Disease Exclusion Diet: A Comprehensive Review of Evidence, Implementation Strategies, Practical Guidance, and Future Directions.\r\nIn severe disease, complicated phenotypes, or with extraintestinal involvement, CDED should be considered on a case-by-case basis, according to physician and dietitians' discretion. More studies are warranted to assess the efficacy of CDED in different scenarios.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Clinical predictors of early and late endoscopic recurrence following ileocolonic resection in Crohn's disease.\r\nWe identified independent clinical predictors of early and late Crohn's disease postoperative endoscopic recurrence. Clinical factors traditionally used for risk stratification failed to predict recurrence and need to be revised.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    A journey to and with the stars: The pancreatic stellate cell story.\r\nThis paper summarises her Palade lecture wherein she reflects on her journey as a medical graduate, an academic and a researcher, with a particular focus on her team's pioneering work on pancreatic stellate cell biology and the role of these cells in health and disease. While there has been much progress in this field with the efforts of researchers worldwide, there is much still to be learned;  thus it is a topic with ample scope for innovative research with the potential to translate into better outcomes for patients with pancreatic disease.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDecreased neutrophil counts prolong inflammation in acute pancreatitis and cause inflammation spillover to distant organs.\r\n Prolonged inflammation was observed in the G-CSF-KO mice. Tissue cleanup by neutrophils during the acute phase of inflammation may influence healing through the chronic phase.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFactors predictive of hospital length of stay in patients with an index episode of acute necrotizing pancreatitis.\r\n We demonstrate that multiple factors including delayed transfers to hospitals with pancreaticobiliary expertise lead to increased length of hospitalization. We suggest various strategies that can be considered to target those gaps and may have a favorable effect on LOS.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImpact of preoperative endoscopic procedures on adverse event rates after surgical resection for main-duct and mixed-type intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs).\r\nPostoperative adverse events were not significantly increased among patients who had ERCP or EUS-FNA before surgical resection for MD- or MT-IPMNs. Endoscopic procedures directly sampling the MD can be safely pursued for diagnostic purposes in selected cases.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNSAIDs do not reduce severity among post-ERCP pancreatitis patients.\r\nRectal diclofenac or indomethacin before or after ERCP reduce the overall burden of MSPEP by reducing the pool of PEP from which it can arise. However, the proportion of MSPEP among patients who developed PEP is unaffected. Therefore, NSAIDs prevent initiation of PEP, but do not affect severity among those that develop PEP. Alternative modalities are needed to reduce MSPEP among patients who develop PEP.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe relationship between observation interval and prognosis in pancreatic cancer concomitant with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia.\r\n In OI 6 months or less, the rate of resectable PC was high, however, the rate of early PC was almost the same as that of OI more than 6 months. Approximately 10 % of cases found in the advanced stage with metastasis even if OI 6 months or less.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the publisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    J Crohns Colitis\r\n    Intestinal Failure: A Small but Imperfectly Phenotyped Complication of Crohn's Disease.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous\r\nmisc publications eg case reports, tools of the trade, images of the month, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Inflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    The Use of Placebo in Clinical Trials of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetters&Replies\r\nLetters to the editors and authors’ replies\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Further studies are needed to validate our data.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Adherence to the Mediterranean diet and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Biomarkers in Older Individuals at High Cardiovascular Risk: Cross-sectional and Longitudinal Analyses.\r\nIn older adults at high cardiometabolic risk, higher MEDAS was associated with modest beneficial changes in lipoprotein and glucose metabolism. The results suggest that lipoprotein subclass distribution and glycemic control are potential mechanisms behind the well-known salutary effects of MedDiet on CVD and diabetes risk. Future clinical trials exploring the effects of the MedDiet on advanced lipoprotein subclass profiles and glucose metabolism markers are needed to confirm the results of our study.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEffectiveness of Intermittent Iron and High-Dose Vitamin A Supplementation on Cognitive Development of Schoolchildren in Southern Ethiopia: A Randomized Placebo Controlled Trial.\r\n In a population where the prevalence of iron deficiency is low, intermittent iron supplementation did not have any or negative effect on the child's cognitive development outcomes. Whereas VA supplementation improved the child's working memory.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInfant Milk Formula with Large, Milk Phospholipid-coated Lipid Droplets Enriched in Dairy Lipids Affects Body Mass Index Trajectories and Blood Pressure at School Age: Follow-up of a Randomized Controlled Trial.\r\nEarly life feeding of an innovative IMF with large, milk phospholipid-coated lipid droplets enriched with dairy lipids results in a BMI trajectory closer to breastfed infants and a lower blood pressure at school age.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSex Disparities in Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition Society Leadership Worldwide: A 20-Year Retrospective Analysis.\r\n Over the last two decades, women have been consistently underrepresented in prominent leadership roles in parenteral and enteral nutrition societies globally. Although there has been a noticeable shift towards more women in chair positions, true sex equality remains elusive. Moreover, sex disparities are even more pronounced in positions such as conference presidents, authors of major guidelines, and editors-in-chief of society-affiliated journals. This data underscores the pressing need to enhance efforts towards sex equality across these domains.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Adalimumab Drug Levels at Secondary Loss of Response Do Not Predict Response to Dose-intensification in Crohn's Disease: A Retrospective, International Multicenter Study.\r\nDrug levels following dose-intensification rather than at the time of secondary loss of response were associated with subsequent CD remission.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nExclusive Enteral Nutrition Mediates Beneficial Gut Microbiome Enrichment in Acute Severe Colitis.\r\nAugmentation of clinical response by EEN-conjugated corticosteroid therapy is accompanied by beneficial gut microbial changes in patients with ASUC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIncidental Dysplasia During Total Proctocolectomy With Ileoanal Pouch: Is It Associated With Worse Outcomes? \r\nPouch survival at 10 years was 96% for PRE, 99% for BOTH, and 97% for POST (P = .24). The incidental finding of dysplasia on final pathology after proctocolectomy was not associated with worsened outcomes compared with preoperatively diagnosed dysplasia.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflammatory Bowel Disease and the Risk of Anal Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions and Anal Cancer in Men Who Have Sex With Men.\r\nAmong MSM with and without IBD, both groups had an equally high prevalence of HSIL and anal SCC. Awareness of appropriate surveillance to identify aSIL in MSM patients with IBD is needed among gastroenterologists.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSingle Nucleotide Polymorphisms of the MEFV Gene E148Q Are Highly Associated With Disease Phenotype in Crohn's Disease.\r\nMEFV gene SNPs, including E148Q, modify the behavior of CD. IL-1ß and IL-18 are produced through enhanced caspase-1 activity in monocytes of CD patients with E148Q. IL-1ß promotes gene expression of fibrosis-related genes by cooperating with IL-17A in myofibroblasts. Therefore, E148Q might be a disease-modifying gene associated with the fibrostenosis phenotype in CD patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    De-escalation of biological treatment in inflammatory bowel disease: A comprehensive review.\r\nAny consideration for de-escalation of biological therapy in IBD must be tailored, taking into account the risks and consequences of a flare and patients' preferences.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImpact of Baseline Corticosteroid Use on the Efficacy and Safety of Upadacitinib in Patients with Ulcerative Colitis: a Post Hoc Analysis of the Phase 3 Clinical Trial Programme.\r\nUpadacitinib is an effective steroid-sparing treatment in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Clinical Efficacy of the NLRX1 agonist NX-13 in Active Ulcerative Colitis: Results of a Phase 1b Study.\r\nNX-13 was generally safe and well tolerated with early signs of rapid symptom and endoscopic improvement. This novel mechanism of action warrants further investigation. ClinicalTrials.gov  NCT04862741.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTreatment of antibiotic refractory chronic pouchitis with JAK inhibitors and S1P receptor modulators: an ECCO CONFER Multicentre Case Series. \r\nNo side effects reported. Small molecules may represent a suitable option for CARP refractory to multiple biologics, deserving further investigation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreas\r\n    Hypophosphatemia as a Predictor of Clinical Outcomes in Acute Pancreatitis: A Retrospective Study.\r\nEarly hypophosphatemia during an admission for AP was associated with increased AP severity, ICU admission, and longer length of stay.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Impact of Race on Pancreatic Cancer Treatment and Survival in the Nationwide Veterans Affairs Healthcare System.\r\nEqual access to healthcare might have reduced but failed to eliminate disparities. Dedicated efforts are needed to understand reasons underlying these disparities in an attempt to close these persistent gaps.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    A journey to and with the stars: The pancreatic stellate cell story.\r\nThis paper summarises her Palade lecture wherein she reflects on her journey as a medical graduate, an academic and a researcher, with a particular focus on her team's pioneering work on pancreatic stellate cell biology and the role of these cells in health and disease. While there has been much progress in this field with the efforts of researchers worldwide, there is much still to be learned;  thus it is a topic with ample scope for innovative research with the potential to translate into better outcomes for patients with pancreatic disease.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClinical characteristics of three distinct types of pancreatitis with overlapping etiologies: A ten-year retrospective cohort study.\r\n ABP usually develops in people aged 50-59 years. HTG-AP primarily affects people aged 30-39 years. However, the peak incidence age of BHAP falls between the two aforementioned age groups (40-49 years). We also found that patients with BHAP seem to be in an intermediate state in terms of some biochemical markers and demographic characteristics. Furthermore, BHAP may have the worst clinical outcomes compared with HTG-AP and ABP.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCysts or necrotic components in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is associated with the risk of EUS-FNA/B complications including needle tract seeding.\r\nWe should pay attention to the risks of EUS-FNA/B complications, including NTS, when the tumor has cysts or necrotic components.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGenetic and functional analysis of chymotrypsin-like protease (CTRL) in chronic pancreatitis.\r\n We identified several CTRL variants, some showing potent effects on protease function and secretion. We observed these effects in variants found in patients and controls, and CTRL loss-of-function variants were not significantly more common in patients than controls. Therefore, CTRL is unlikely to play a relevant role in the development of CP.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIncreased plasma miR-370-3p expression in poor-outcome patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.\r\nPlasma miR-370-3p expression upregulation correlates with poor prognosis in patients with PDAC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOverexpression of the adhesion signaling pathway is linked to short-term survival in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.\r\n The role of integrins in the tumor microenvironment of pancreatic cancer is of utmost importance, as they are found to be overexpressed in short-term survivors. These findings provide valuable insights into the underlying biology of PDAC and have potential implications for the development of therapeutic strategies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreas volumes in pediatric patients following index acute pancreatitis and acute recurrent pancreatitis.\r\nA significant fraction (40 %) of children with ARP have pancreas volumes <5th percentile for BSA even in the absence of CP. A similar, but not statistically significant, fraction have pancreas volumes <25th percentile after an index attack of AP. Pancreatic parenchymal volume deserves additional investigation as an objective marker of parenchymal damage from acute pancreatitis and of progressive pancreatitis in children.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the publisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous\r\nmisc publications eg case reports, tools of the trade, images of the month, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Inflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Cancer Screening in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Don't Forget the Anus!\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Kidney injuries as Extra Intestinal Manifestation of Inflammatory Bowel Disease. \r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreas\r\n    Immune Enhancement in Patients With Predicted Severe Acute Necrotizing Pancreatitis: Important Implications for Timing and Early Stratification.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nResponse to Letter to the Editor \"Design Flaws in Study of Prophylaxis of Postendoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography Pancreatitis\" by Feng Liu et al.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nWidespread Hyperalgesia by Pancreatic Quantitative Sensory Testing Is Associated With Reduced Pain Response in Chronic Pancreatitis.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetters&Replies\r\nLetters to the editors and authors’ replies\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Although differences in the genetic constitution play an important role in the epidemiology and prognosis of IBD in SEA, the emergence of this disease offers a unique opportunity to identify potential exposomes that contribute to its pathogenesis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRates of Endoscopic Recurrence In Postoperative Crohn's Disease Based on Anastomotic Techniques: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.\r\nKono-S ileocolic anastomosis was more likely to decrease the risk of ePOR at =6 months compared with conventional anastomosis. Our findings highlight the need to implement the use of Kono-S anastomosis, particularly for difficult to treat patients. However, results from larger randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these data.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Pharmacological therapies for the management of fistulising Crohn's disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.\r\n Very low-to-moderate certainty evidence suggests that anti-TNF therapy, oral small molecules, ustekinumab, and MSCs are effective for perianal fistulising CD. Dedicated fistula studies evaluating biologics and small molecules are needed.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Adherence to a healthy lifestyle, genetic susceptibility to abdominal obesity, cardiometabolic risk markers, and risk of coronary heart disease.\r\nIndividuals who have high or medium genetic risk of abdominal obesity but adhere to a healthy lifestyle may have a lower risk of developing CHD, compared with those who have low genetic risk and an unhealthy lifestyle. Future clinical trials of lifestyle modification could be implemented for individuals at high genetic risk of abdominal obesity for the primary prevention of CHD events.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAssociation of Dietary Adherence and Dietary Quality with Weight Loss Success among those Following Low-Carbohydrate and Low-Fat Diets: A Secondary Analysis of the DIETFITS Randomized Clinical Trial.\r\n Within both HLC and HLF diet arms, 12-month decrease in BMI was significantly greater in HQ/HA subgroups relative to LQ/LA subgroups. Neither HQ nor HA alone were significantly different than LQ/LA subgroups. Results of this analysis support the combination of dietary adherence and high-quality diets for weight loss.

Adherence to a cholesterol-rich dietary pattern during early pregnancy promotes the chance of GDM, especially in women with higher GRS. Clinical trial registry\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGrowth and Body Composition 5 y After Treatment for Severe Acute Malnutrition: A 5-y Prospective Matched Cohort Study in Ethiopian Children.\r\nFive y after SAM treatment, children maintained deficits in HAZ, WAZ, BAZ, and FFMI, with preservation of FMI, sitting height, and head circumference at the expense of lower-limb length, indicating a \"thrifty growth\" pattern. Research is urgently needed to identify effective clinical and public health interventions to mitigate these consequences of malnutrition.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLongitudinal associations of macronutrient and micronutrient intake with plasma kynurenines in colorectal cancer survivors up to 12 months posttreatment.\r\nOur findings show that intake of several macronutrients and micronutrients is associated with some metabolites of the kynurenine pathway in CRC survivors up to 12 mo posttreatment. These results may be relevant for enhancing HRQoL after cancer through potential diet-induced changes in kynurenines. Further studies are necessary to confirm our findings.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe gut microbiome modulates associations between adherence to a Mediterranean-style Diet, abdominal adiposity and C-reactive protein in population-level analysis.\r\n These novel data suggest that abundance of specific taxa in the Porphyromonadaceae and Peptostreptococcaceae families may contribute to the association between aMed scores, lower abdominal adipose tissue, and inflammation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    An Insight into Patients' Perspectives of Ulcerative Colitis Flares via Analysis of Online Public Forum Posts.\r\nFrequently discussed patient-perceived triggers of UC flares included diet, stress, and anxiety. These results suggest that physicians could incorporate a broader and more holistic approach to UC monitoring and management than is currently practiced.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCrohn's Disease Mortality and Ambient Air Pollution in New York City.\r\nIn New York City from 1993 to 2010, CD-related death rates were higher among individuals from neighborhoods with higher levels of SO2 but were not associated with levels of nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, and fine particulate matter. These findings raise an important and timely public health issue regarding exposure of CD patients to environmental SO2, warranting further exploration.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEarly-Life Hygiene-Related Factors and Risk of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Scandinavian Birth Cohort Study.\r\nIn this birth cohort study from 2 high-income Scandinavian countries, some early-life hygiene-related exposures were associated with IBD risk. The generalizability of these results to countries of other socioeconomic level is unknown.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImpact of Opioid Use on the Natural History of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Prospective Longitudinal Follow-up Study.\r\nOpioid use in IBD is associated with psychological comorbidity and increased risk of intestinal resection, particularly in stronger formulations. Future studies should stratify the risk of individual opioids, so that robust prescribing algorithms can be developed and assess whether addressing psychological factors in routine IBD care could be an effective opioid avoidance strategy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReal-World Persistence of Successive Biologics in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Findings From ROTARY.\r\nAlthough anti-TNFa treatments were most commonly prescribed, the adjusted rates of discontinuation for adalimumab as both a first- and second-line biologic were higher than for vedolizumab, infliximab, or ustekinumab.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTreating Autoimmune Diseases With LANCL2 Therapeutics: A Novel Immunoregulatory Mechanism for Patients With Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's Disease.\r\nOmilancor, the most advanced LANCL2 immunoregulatory therapeutic in late-stage clinical development, is a phase 3 ready, first-in-class, gut-restricted, oral, once-daily, small-molecule therapeutic in clinical development for the treatment of UC and CD. In this review, we discuss this novel mechanism of mucosal immunoregulation and how LANCL2-targeting therapeutics could help address the unmet clinical needs of patients with autoimmune diseases, starting with IBD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Antibody responses to Influenza vaccination are diminished in patients with inflammatory bowel disease on infliximab or tofacitinib.\r\nVaccination in both the 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 seasons was associated with significantly higher antibody responses to influenza/A than no vaccination or vaccination in 2021-2022 alone. Infliximab and tofacitinib are associated with lower binding antibody responses to Influenza/A, similar to COVID-19 vaccine-induced antibody responses.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCancer Biology or Ineffective Surveillance? A multicentre retrospective analysis of colitis-associated post-colonoscopy colorectal cancers.\r\nIBD PCCRC prevention will require more proactive strategies to reduce endoscopic inflammatory burden, improve lesion optical characterisation, adherence to recommended surveillance intervals and patient acceptance of prophylactic colectomy. However, the significant proportion appearing to originate from non-adenomatous-looking mucosa which fail to yield neoplasia on biopsy yet display aggressive cancer evolution highlight the limitations of current surveillance. Emerging molecular biomarkers may play a role in enhancing cancer risk stratification in future clinical practice.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDe-escalation of biological treatment in inflammatory bowel disease: A comprehensive review.\r\nAny consideration for de-escalation of biological therapy in IBD must be tailored, taking into account the risks and consequences of a flare and patients' preferences.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEarly versus Late Use of Vedolizumab in Ulcerative Colitis: Clinical, Endoscopic, and Histological Outcomes.\r\nNo significant differences in clinical, endoscopic, and histological outcomes were observed between \"early\" and \"late\" disease.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHigher serum infliximab concentrations following subcutaneous dosing are associated with deep remission in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.\r\n Higher SC-IFX concentrations are associated with higher rates of favorable therapeutic outcomes in IBD patients.

Cu concentration was strongly correlated with APRs and infection status suggesting its potential role in inflammation, a pathway implicated in the mechanisms of PTB. Therefore, maternal Cu could be used as potential marker of integrated inflammatory pathways during pregnancy and risk for preterm birth.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Children's energy intake generally increases in response to the energy density of meals but varies with the amounts and types of foods served.\r\nChildren's energy intake generally increased with greater ED;  at higher-ED meals, however, energy intake decreased in a curvilinear manner without a clear breakpoint. This reduction in intake at higher ED could be explained by meal-related factors such as the portions served, rather than by sensitivity to meal energy content.
