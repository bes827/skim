This report presents 28 recommendations from the working group focused on addressing clinically relevant questions related to the preoperative aspects of living donor safety including assessment of donor acceptability (age, body mass index and hepatic steatosis;  medical conditions and contraindications), medical and surgical workup (liver function and procoagulant work-up;  anatomical considerations and safe remnant), and psychosocial evaluation (timing and team;  underlying conditions;  non-directed, paired, and anonymous directed donors;  urgent living donor workups for acute liver failure).\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Pancreas\n    Bridging Guidelines and Patient Preferences in IPMN Care.\n\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \n\n\nMeta-analysis\nmeta-analyses and systematic reviews\n\n\n    \n\n\nOriginal articles\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\n\n\n    Am J Clin Nutr\n    Alignment with Front-of-Package Labelling Policy and Risk of Hospitalization: Evidence from Canadian National Nutrition Survey Linked to Routinely Collected Health Administrative Databases.\nIn this exploratory analysis, greater alignment with FOP policy was associated with fewer hospital bed-days over 5 and 10 years. Sex-tailored risk-reduction strategies may be warranted with the strongest association in males. These findings reinforce the value of the \"high-in\" symbol;  however, the nutrient-specific focus may still miss broader dimensions of diet quality. Complementary, whole-diet guidance remains essential to maximise population-level benefits and health-system savings.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Comparing Postprandial Inflammatory Responses to a Plant-Based Meat Alternative, Grass-Finished Beef, and Grain-Finished Beef in Healthy Middle-Aged Adults: A Three-Group Randomized Crossover Trial.\nDespite differences in nutrient composition, acute consumption of grass-finished beef, a plant-based meat alternative, and grain-finished beef did not elicit significantly different postprandial inflammatory responses. These findings suggest that, in the short term, the choice between these protein sources may not meaningfully impact inflammation. Further research is needed to explore potential long-term health implications. Clinical trial registry\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Prediabetes, Diabetes and Folate Status among U.S. Women of Reproductive Age: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011-March 2020.\nDiabetes and prediabetes were common among WRA. Diabetes was associated with high RBC folate concentration and high MeFox despite low folic acid intake;  however, these associations were reduced among those with good glycemic control. Screening for and preventing the progression of prediabetes, diagnosis, and glycemic control among those with diabetes has the potential to prevent adverse outcomes.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Inflamm Bowel Dis\n    A Real-World Longitudinal Case-Study Implementing Digital Screening and Treatment for Distress in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: The COMPASS-IBD Patient Journey.\nRoutine mental health screening and COMPASS-IBD were successfully implemented in an outpatient IBD service, but support from trainee psychologists and the research team was required. This new integrated pathway can identify and treat psychological distress in IBD with minimal service resource.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Efficacy, Safety, and Pharmacokinetics of Golimumab in Children with Moderately-To-Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: Results from the PURSUIT 2 Study.\nOverall, the results of the PURSUIT 2 study support golimumab treatment for children with moderately-to-severely active UC.

Greater efforts are needed to foster agricultural initiatives that promote food sovereignty and reduce nutrition-related health disparities, but their viability in this region will depend on future supply-demand dynamics that are influenced by changing political landscapes.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx J Crohns Colitis\n    Intestinal Barrier healing is superior to transmural healing to prevent disease progession in clinical remittent patients with IBD.\n Intestinal barrier healing is superior to transmural healing to prevent disease progession in clinical remittent IBD patients while both barrier and transmural healing showed superiority over endoscopic and histologic remission. Hence, barrier and transmural healing are emerging endpoints potentially refining disease monitoring and outcome prediction.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Research Progress on Exclusive Enteral Nutrition Combined with Biologics in the Treatment of Adult Crohn's Disease.\n Combined therapy with Exclusive Enteral Nutrition (EEN) and biologics shows promise in managing complex Crohn's Disease (CD), with studies reporting improved remission rates. This clinical benefit may be attributed to a synergistic effect supported by a plausible biological basis. However, these favorable outcomes are based on low-certainty evidence from limited clinical studies. Robust randomized controlled trials are needed to establish the effectiveness, safety, and best use of this combination approach.

The presence of a known umbilical hernia prior to TIPS had the strongest association with this complication. Serum creatinine and albumin association also suggests ascites severity as a contributor. Identifying pre-TIPS risk factors could facilitate the development of targeted strategies to mitigate post-TIPS complications.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Pancreas\n    Implementation of an Electronic Clinical Decision Support Order Set for Acute Pancreatitis in an Integrated Healthcare System: A Mixed Methods Analysis.\n Although adoption was limited, usage of an AP OES/CDS tool was associated with a decrease in prolonged length-of-stay. Future efforts to expand the reach of such instruments through provider awareness and refinement of the instrument may facilitate broader impact for management of patients with acute pancreatitis.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \n\n\nReviews&Editorials\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\npublisher website using the provided link\n\n\n    \n\n\nMiscellaneous\nmisc publications eg case reports, tools of the trade, images of\nthe month, etc…\n\n\n    \n\n\nLetters&Replies\nLetters to the editors and authors’ replies\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
