However, most studies had risk of bias due to the randomization process or deviations from intended interventions. Conclusions MNT plays a key role in improving cardiometabolic risk factors in adults with prediabetes. Registration id and url ID #351421; \r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Prevalence of hepatobiliary manifestations in inflammatory bowel disease: a GRADE assessed systematic review and meta-analysis on more than 1.7 million patients.\r\n This study summarizes the prevalence and importance of different hepatic manifestations in IBD patients. These findings are crucial for the management of EIMs, especially hepatic manifestations, in IBD patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTemporary Faecal Diversion for Refractory Perianal and/or Distal Colonic Crohn's Disease in the Biologic Era: An Updated Systematic Review with Meta-Analysis.\r\n In the biologic era, temporary FD for refractory perianal and/or distal colonic CD improves symptoms half the patients, and bowel continuity can be successfully restored in a quarter of patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    Treatment strategies of hepatic artery complications after pediatric liver transplantation: A systematic review.\r\nDespite various treatment methods, HAT after pLT remains a significant issue that has profound effects on the patient and graft survivals.

Thus, intervention strategies to improve dietary sustainability need to be tailored differently to females and males. Diet quality should also be considered when promoting reduced GHGE diets.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Characterization of the Gut Microbiota and Mycobiota in Italian Pediatric Patients With Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis and Ulcerative Colitis.\r\nWe describe the gut microbiota and mycobiota dysbiosis associated to PSC-UC disease. Our results evidenced a gut imbalance, with the reduction of gut commensal microorganisms with stated anti-inflammatory properties (ie, Akkermansia, Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, Oscillospira, Meyerozyma, and Malassezia) and the increase of pathobionts (ie, Streptococcus, Saccharomyces, and Debaryomyces) that could be involved in PSC progression. Altogether, these events may concur in the pathophysiology of PSC in the framework of UC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nExpression of Circulating let-7e and miR-126 May Predict Clinical Remission in Patients With Crohn's Disease Treated With Anti-TNF-a Biologics.\r\n These results provide evidence that expression levels of circulating let-7e and miR-126 at baseline may predict clinical remission in CD patients treated with anti-TNF-a biologics.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRacial and Ethnic Disparities in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: An Online Survey.\r\nBIPOC/H patients with IBD had worse clinical disease, lower HRQOL scores, had more medication concerns, had less access to specialists, had less social and emotional support, and used emergency department services more often than W/NH patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Mitigating the risk of Tofacitinib-induced adverse events in the elderly population with Ulcerative Colitis.\r\nModulation of induction dose and anti-thrombotic therapy may have contributed to prevent cardiologic events and thromboembolism. The introduction of zoster vaccine virtually eliminated zoster risk after the first cases. Potential malignancies deserve a careful work-up of older patients before treatment start.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nProspective Observational Evaluation of the Time-Dependency of Adalimumab Immunogenicity and Drug Concentration in Ulcerative Colitis Patients: the POETIC II Study.\r\nLoss of response to adalimumab therapy was significantly more common in the Ulcerative Colitis compared to the Crohn's disease cohort and was driven by a higher rate of non-immunogenic, pharmacodynamic parameters.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nValidation of the IBD-Control Questionnaire across different sociodemographic and clinical subgroups: Secondary analysis of a nationwide electronic survey.\r\nIBD-Control-8 is a psychometrically robust scale which can be used across a range of populations.

In terms of changes in BW, BMI, and WC, there is firm evidence for the overall weight-loss effects of GLP-1RAs. Of the GLP-1RAs, semaglutide might be the most effective agent.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nVitamin D supplementation for improving bone density in vitamin D-deficient children and adolescents: systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.\r\nClinically important benefits for bone density from 1-y vitamin D supplementation in healthy children and adolescents, regardless of baseline vitamin D status, are unlikely. However, our findings are mostly generalizable to White postpubertal girls and do not apply to those with baseline 25(OH)D outside the studied range or with symptomatic vitamin D deficiency (e.g., rickets). This study was preregistered at PROSPERO as CRD42017068772.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Defining the Roles of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Clinical Pharmacists in the United States: A Systematic Review and National RAND/UCLA Consensus.\r\nThis consensus defines IBD clinical pharmacists' roles and provides a framework for embedded clinical pharmacists in IBD care.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nUnveiling the Ghrelin and Obestatin Roles in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Assessing Their Pathogenic Implications and Biomarker Utility.\r\nOur results demonstrate that IBD patients with active disease have higher levels of ghrelin, which needs to be confirmed in future studies. Also, the obestatin/ghrelin ratio might be a promising biomarker for the assessment of disease activity.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Associations of Dietary Sugar Types with Coronary Heart Disease Risk: A Prospective Cohort Study.\r\nIntakes of TGE, total sugar, added sugar, and fructose from added sugar and juice were associated with higher CHD risk, but TFE and fructose from fruits and vegetables were not.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDiet-induced Weight Loss and Phenotypic Flexibility Among Healthy Overweight Adults: A Randomized Trial.\r\n Application of dietary challenges increased sensitivity to detect metabolic response to weight loss intervention. Large interindividual variation was observed across a wide range of measurements allowing the identification of distinct responses to the weight loss intervention and mechanistic insight into the metabolic response to weight loss.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGlutamate infusion reduces myocardial dysfunction after coronary artery bypass grafting according to NT-proBNP: summary of two randomized controlled trials (GLUTAMICS I-II).\r\nInfusion of glutamate reduced postoperative rise in NT-proBNP after CABG in medium to high-risk patients. A significantly blunted effect was observed only in insulin-treated diabetes patients. Clinical trial registration\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIntraduodenal nutrient infusion differentially alters intestinal nutrient sensing, appetite, and satiety responses in lean and obese subjects.\r\n Nutrient-induced gut hormone release and response to transient vagal blockade are significantly blunted in subjects with obesity.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInulin-type fructans and 2'fucosyllactose alter both microbial composition and appear to alleviate stress-induced mood state in a working population compared to placebo (maltodextrin): the EFFICAD Trial, a randomized, controlled trial.\r\n The results of this study indicate that oligofructose and combination of oligofructose/2'fucosyllactose, can beneficially alter microbial composition along with improving mood state parameters. Future work is needed to understand key microbial differences separating individual responses to 2'fucosyllactose supplementation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPericonceptional intakes of methyl donors and other micronutrients involved in one-carbon metabolism may further reduce the risk of neural tube defects in offspring: a United States population-based case-control study of women meeting the folic acid recommendations.\r\nOur findings support that NTD prevention, in the context of folic acid fortification, could be augmented with intakes of methyl donors and other micronutrients involved in folate metabolism.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nUntargeted Metabolomic Analysis Investigating Links Between Unprocessed Red Meat Intake and Markers of Inflammation.\r\nOur analyses were unable to support a relationship between either processed or unprocessed red meat and inflammation, over and above any confounding by BMI. Glutamine, a plasma correlate of lower unprocessed red meat intake, was associated with lower CRP levels. The differences in diet-inflammation associations vs diet metabolite-inflammation associations warrants further investigation to understand the extent that these arise from (1) a reduction in measurement error with metabolite measures;  (2) the extent that factors other than unprocessed red meat intake contribute to glutamine levels;  (3) the ability of plasma metabolites to capture individual differences in how food intake is metabolized.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Gut Microbiota Composition in Long-Remission Ulcerative Colitis is Close to a Healthy Gut Microbiota.\r\nRecovery may just reflect adequate control of inflammatory activity, but higher bacterial diversity or the presence of A. muciniphila in fecal samples predicts flare-free outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nManagement of Perianal Fistulizing Crohn's Disease.\r\nIn this review, we provide an up-to-date overview of the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and medical management of perianal fistulizing CD.
