A multisectoral approach to stunting reduction in Nigeria appears to have been key, with progress having been driven by both the health sector and, especially, non-health sector action.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nA mixed-methods study of the drivers of stunting reduction among children under-5 in Ghana, 2003-2017. \r\nOf 134 nutrition-related policies and programs identified in our review, 23 national initiatives were assessed as having contributed importantly to reducing stunting in Ghana, reflecting the effectiveness of multisectoral action. Stunting reduction can be accelerated even further in Ghana through increased coverage of high-quality nutrition-specific interventions and greater health and nonhealth sector investments.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nA mixed-methods study of the drivers of stunting reduction among children under-5 in Sierra Leone, 2005-2017. \r\nRapid reduction in under-5 stunting in Sierra Leone coincided with strong economic growth and declining urban poverty, along with high-profile health and development policies supported by external partners that targeted and/or benefited poorer and rural populations especially. Had the Ebola and COVID-19 epidemics not occurred, positive pre-2014 trajectories in child growth and other maternal and child health and nutrition outcomes in Sierra Leone may well have continued, yielding gains even larger than those observed over the study period.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDrivers of anemia reduction among women of reproductive age in Pakistan: a mixed-methods country case study. \r\nOBDA explained 89% of the observed change in mean hemoglobin, with household enrollment in the Benazir Income Support Program (36%), household wealth (17%), and improvement in women's nutrition [body mass index (in kg/m2): 15%, serum retinol: 12%] emerging as the most critical drivers of anemia decline among nonpregnant women in Pakistan. To protect these gains and continue improvements, anemia prevention efforts should continue to focus on improving healthcare access, women's economic empowerment, and poverty alleviation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDrivers of anemia reduction among women of reproductive age in Uganda: a country case study. \r\nTo protect the hard-fought gains and continue improvements, WRA anemia prevention efforts in Uganda should remain focused on improving health care access especially within antenatal care and malaria control programs. Additionally, multisectoral collaborations and investments to empower women and poverty alleviation strategies need to be enhanced.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInvestigating the impact of body composition on the estimation of resting metabolic rate: new equations for adults aged ≥65 years developed using cross-sectional data.\r\nNew prediction equations predict RMR at the population level with minimal bias;  however, the difference in performance with anthropometry-based equations is minimal. This may be explained by the contribution of FFM to weight, whereby equations that include weight are already accounting for FFM.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMethods Matter for Dietary Supplement Exposure Assessment: Comparing Prevalence, Product Types, and Amounts of Nutrients from Dietary Supplements in the Interactive Diet and Activity Tracking in AARP Cohort Study.\r\nWithin IDATA, the comparability of ASA24 and DHQII in estimating the prevalence of use of and nutrient intakes from DS fluctuates by nutrient and product type. DS approaches beyond a questionnaire may be warranted for estimating absolute nutrient amounts, and the choice of the DS assessment method depends on the nutrient/dietary component of interest.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPhosphate-based additives in processed foods: is excess exposure a cause for concern? A cross-sectional examination of the United States packaged food supply.\r\nThis study illustrates widespread exposure to P-additives in al packaged food and beverage categories in the United States, with sales-weighted data showing a high volume of purchases even in categories containing a lower percentage of products with P-additives. Research exploring the safety of excessive P-additive exposure in CKD and healthy populations requires the Food and Drug Administration to make labeling of the total phosphorus content on nutrition facts labels mandatory.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSocial sector drivers and stunting reduction in Pakistan: A subnational analysis. \r\nAlthough national progress in stunting reduction remains slow, regions of KP, Northern, and Southern Punjab have demonstrated significant reductions in child stunting prevalence between 2011 and 2018. Our analysis supports continued investments in social sector programs targeting females' health and status and strengthening the reach and quality of existing maternal and child health and nutrition programs.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nWhat works for anemia reduction among women of reproductive age? Synthesized findings from the exemplars in anemia project. \r\nA context-specific, multisectoral approach is needed to decrease WRA anemia, incorporating direct nutritional interventions and indirect strategies within the health and nonhealth sectors. Lessons from the successes and challenges from exemplar countries could help accelerate global anemia reduction.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nWhat works for reducing stunting in low-income and middle-income countries? Cumulative learnings from the Global Stunting Exemplars Project. \r\nIn malarial endemic areas, malaria control programs were associated with improved childhood growth, and patterns of growth indicated continued benefits of childhood disease prevention and management strategies. A systematic, evidence-informed approach to improve maternal and child health and nutrition is feasible and, with targeting, can accelerate reduction in linear growth faltering in childhood.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Assessment and Impact of Age on the Safety and Efficacy of Etrasimod in Patients With Ulcerative Colitis: A Post Hoc Analysis of Data From the ELEVATE UC Clinical Program.\r\nThe safety profile of etrasimod 2 mg QD in the ELEVATE UC population was consistent across age groups, with no change in the incidence of AEs. Patients receiving etrasimod vs placebo showed significant clinical benefit, regardless of age.  NCT03945188;  NCT03996369.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHealth Outcomes, Discrimination, and Stigma Among Sexual and Gender Minority People With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\nSGM individuals with IBD are more likely to experience discrimination, including in healthcare, and illness-related stigma. These may significantly impact the quality of life and should be considered in the care of SGM people with IBD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIncidence of Osteoporosis and Osteopenia in Newly Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Population-Based Cohort Study.\r\nThis population-based study demonstrated high rates of osteoporosis among postmenopausal women and males aged ≥ 50 years at IBD diagnosis, highlighting the need for systematic evaluation in these patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Association of Bile Acid Diarrhea with Symptoms and Disease Activity in Crohn's Disease: Post-Hoc Clinical Trial Analysis of Serum 7a-hydroxy-4cholestern-3-one, C4, in Patients with Active Crohn's Disease. \r\nClinicalTrials. gov NCT02065570.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEffectiveness and safety of rectal tacrolimus in patients with ulcerative colitis. TACRO-TOPIC study of GETECCU. \r\nAdverse events were detected in 21 patients (14.2%), with twelve graded as mild and nine moderate (42.6%).
