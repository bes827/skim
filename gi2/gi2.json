We provide recommendations on diagnostic evaluation, as well as suggestions for future research.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPhysical Activity Is Associated With A Decreased Risk Of Developing Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.\r\n This meta-analysis suggests that physical activity is inversely associated with the risk of developing IBD, more so in CD than in UC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Associations Among Diabetes Medication Use, Serum Magnesium, and Insulin Resistance in a Cohort of Older Puerto Rican Adults.\r\nDiabetes medication, especially metformin, was associated with elevated odds of hypomagnesemia, which may weaken the association between metformin and lowering of HOMA-IR. The causal inference needs to be confirmed in further studies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPlant-based meat analogues (PBMAs) and their effects on cardiometabolic health: An 8-week randomized controlled trial comparing PBMAs with their corresponding animal-based foods.\r\nA plant-based meat analogues diet did not show widespread cardiometabolic health benefits compared with omnivorous diets over 8 weeks. The composition of PBMAs may need to be considered in future trials. Clinical trial registration\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nProportions of trans fatty acids in erythrocyte of Canadian adults before the prohibition of partially hydrogenated oils in foods: Results from the Canadian Health Measures Survey 2012-2015.\r\nPre-PHO prohibition in food in Canada, t-TFA proportions were relatively low compared with a proposed threshold of 1% of total RBC fatty acids over which cardiovascular risk may be higher. Previous voluntary initiatives to reduce i-TFA in the food supply may explain these relatively low RBC t-TFA levels. Some population subgroups had higher baseline RBC TFA than other subgroups, but the physiological implications of these small differences, at relatively low baseline RBC TFA proportions, remain to be determined. Clinical trial registry number Not applicable REGISTRY AND REGISTRY NUMBER FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS OF META-ANALYSIS  Not applicable.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Changes Over Time in the Lémann Index and the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Disability Index in a Prospective Cohort of Patients With Crohn's Disease.\r\nThis is the first prospective cohort study assessing changes over time in both the LI and the IBD-DI in CD patients. After 4 years, the LI appeared to be stable and the IBD-DI decreased, with no correlation between the 2 indexes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDurability of the First Biologic in Children and Adults With Ulcerative Colitis: A Nationwide Study from the epi-IIRN.\r\n After 5 years of treatment, 43% of the patients with UC sustained their first biologic, with similar durability in pediatric and adult-onset onset disease. Anti-TNFs had similar durability to vedolizumab and superior durability when prescribed as combotherapy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInequalities in Healthcare Access, Experience and Outcomes in Adults With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Scoping Review.\r\nFurther research, particularly utilizing qualitative methods, is needed to understand health experiences of underserved patient populations with IBD. Cultural humility in IBD care is required to better serve individuals with IBD of Black and Asian race/ethnicity. The lack of research amongst sexual and gender minority groups with IBD, and with learning disabilities, poses a risk of creating inequalities within inequalities.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIntestinal Stromal Cells in the Turmoil of Inflammation and Defective Connective Tissue Remodeling in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\nCurrent IBD treatments target inflammation but fail in fibrostenotic or fistulizing disease. Baseline and recent findings on stromal cells, molecules, and pathways involved in disrupted extracellular matrix homeostasis are reviewed to provide relevant pharmacologic targets.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNOD2 and Crohn's Disease Clinical Practice: From Epidemiology to Diagnosis and Therapy, Rewired.\r\nEventually, their role in increasing the risk for surgery is evident, especially in those with the L1007fs variant. If further trials will support the initial evidence reported so far, NOD2 genetic variants will emerge as possible candidates for developing precision medicine in CD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Farming activities and risk of inflammatory bowel disease: a French nationwide population-based cohort study.\r\nFurther research regarding specific farming activities and exposures likely to modify the microbiota (e.g., pesticides, pathogens) is required to identify potential occupational risk factors (agricultural exposome) for IBD. Exposure to Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis, cryptosporidium, environmental toxins, micro/nanoplastics, and pesticides represents promising research avenues.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFecal Microbiota Transplantation engraftment after budesonide or placebo in patients with active ulcerative colitis using pre-selected donors: a randomized pilot study.\r\n In this small study, pretreatment with budesonide did not significantly influence engraftment or clinical response after FMT. However, clinical response appeared donor-dependent. Response to FMT may be related to transfer of specific strains instead of overall engraftment, demonstrating the need to characterize mechanisms of actions of strains that maximize therapeutic benefit in ulcerative colitis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNew surgery and hospital-diagnosed infections in elderly patients with inflammatory bowel disease undergoing surgery - a nationwide cohort study.\r\n The elderly with IBD did not have an increased risk of new abdominal surgery within two years of the first surgery. Elderly with CD, but not UC, had an increased risk of serious infections within 6 months of surgery.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreas\r\n    Clinical and Economic Implications of Interventions in Pancreatic Fluid Collections: An Assessment From a National Claims Database.\r\nAs percutaneous drainage may be associated with higher mortality, rehospitalization, and costs, when requisite expertise is available, endoscopy should be preferred for treatment of PFC amenable to such an approach. Randomized trials are required to validate these findings.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTHE ADDED VALUE OF BLOOD GLUCOSE MONITORING IN HIGH-RISK INDIVIDUALS UNDERGOING PANCREATIC CANCER SURVEILLANCE.\r\nIn this study we found no added value for longitudinal glucose monitoring in CDKN2A PV carriers participating in an imaging-based pancreatic cancer surveillance program.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    Development of a novel CT-based index for predicting the number of extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) sessions required for successful fragmentation of obstructing pancreatic duct stones.\r\n The PDS index is a useful predictor of the number of ESWL sessions needed for technical success that can help in planning and patient counseling.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTreatment outcomes of gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel in pancreatic cancer patients with malignant ascites.\r\n GnP showed moderate efficacy with manageable safety profile in PC patients with MA. However, PC patients with moderate to massive ascites still have a dismal prognosis, and further development of effective treatments is needed.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Inflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Ustekinumab and Vedolizumab Exposure Is Unaffected by Pharmacogenetic Determinants of Anti-TNFs Pharmacokinetics.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    Pancreatic anastomosis training models: Current status and future directions.\r\nIt is concluded that research is needed to understand the mechanical properties of the human pancreas in an effort to develop a synthetic model that closely mimics its mechanical properties. Virtual reality (VR) is an attractive alternative to synthetic models for surgical training, and further work is needed to develop a VR pancreatic anastomosis training module that provides both high fidelity and haptic feedback.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous\r\nmisc publications eg case reports, tools of the trade, images of\r\nthe month, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Inflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Bowel Damage and Disability in Crohn's Disease: Is it Really Two Birds with One Stone?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTofacitinib as a Rescue Therapy for Ulcerative Colitis in Pregnancy.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nUstekinumab Offers Long-Term Clinical Remission With Safety in Very Early-Onset Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetters&Replies\r\nLetters to the editors and authors’ replies\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Adequate consideration of context and nutritional requirements is required to develop evidence-based recommendations. This study was registered prospectively with PROSPERO (CRD42021239713).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNational taxation on sugar-sweetened beverages and its association with overweight, obesity, and diabetes.\r\nTaxation is highly heterogeneous across countries in terms of products and design, which might influence its effectiveness. Our findings provide some evidence regarding a deceleration of the increasing prevalence rates of overweight and obesity among children occurring in some countries following introduction of taxation. PROSPERO registration number  CRD42021233309.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Inter- and Intraobserver Variability on Endoscopic Scoring Systems in Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.\r\nThe interobserver agreement rates for eMS, UCEIS, CDEIS, and SES-CD ranged from moderate to good. The intraobserver agreement rates for eMS, UCEIS, CDEIS, and SES-CD ranged from good to very good. Solutions to improve interobserver agreement could allow for more accurate patient assessment, leading to richer, more accurate clinical management and clinical trial data.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOperating Properties of Disease Activity Indices in Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review.\r\nThe operating properties of pIBD clinical trial end points varied widely. These results highlight the need for further validation and development of novel indices.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Letter to the Editor regarding the article Minimally invasive surgery for Inflammatory Bowel Disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of robotic versus laparoscopic surgical techniques.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Cognition after a 4-week high phenylalanine intake in adults with phenylketonuria - a randomized controlled trial.\r\nIn early-treated adult patients with PKU, a 4-week high Phe intake was noninferior to continuing Phe restriction regarding working memory accuracy, and secondary outcomes did not differ except for sustained attention. Longer-term RCTs are required to determine whether low Phe levels need to be maintained throughout different periods of adulthood.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFish oil supplementation during pregnancy, anthropometrics, and metabolic health at age ten: A randomized clinical trial.\r\nIn this randomized clinical trial, children of mothers receiving n-3 LCPUFA supplementation had increased BMI at age 10 y, increased risk of being overweight, and a tendency of increased fat percentage and higher metabolic syndrome score. These findings suggest potential adverse health effects from n-3 LCPUFA supplementation during pregnancy and need to be replicated in future independent studies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut metabolome and microbiota signatures predict response to treatment with exclusive enteral nutrition in a prospective study in children with active Crohn's disease.\r\nWe identify microbial signals and diet-related metabolites in feces, which could comprise targets for pretreatment optimization and personalized nutritional therapy in pediatric CD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nParenteral n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids supplementation improves postoperative recovery for patients with Crohn's disease after bowel resection: a randomized, unblinded controlled clinical trial.\r\nParenteral n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids supplementation promotes postoperative recovery in patients with Crohn's disease following bowel resection, with fewer complications and reduced inflammatory cytokines.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Increased Risk of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Among Patients With Nontyphoidal Salmonella Infections: A Population-Based Cohort Study.\r\nPatients with NTS were associated with an increased risk of developing IBD, especially ulcerative colitis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNaringin Alleviates Intestinal Fibrosis by Inhibiting ER Stress-Induced PAR2 Activation.\r\nMoreover, F2rl1 (the coding gene of PAR2) deletion in intestinal epithelial cells decreases the antifibrotic effect of NAR. Hence, the ER stress-mast cell tryptase-PAR2 axis can promote intestinal fibrosis, and NAR administration can alleviate intestinal fibrosis by inhibiting ER stress-induced PAR2 activation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPrior Appendectomy Is Associated With a Milder Clinical Course in Crohn's Disease: A Nationwide Population-based Cohort Study.\r\n The clinical course of CD is milder for those who have previously undergone appendectomy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRediversion of the Failing Ileoanal Pouch: First Step in Pouch Salvage?\r\n Rediversion of ileoanal pouches is a safe initial strategy to manage failing pouches and is a useful first step in pouch salvage in many patients. Subsequent salvage surgery for noninflammatory indications had a significantly higher pouch salvage rate than those rediverted for inflammatory complications.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Norepinephrine-QseC Axis Aggravates F. nucleatum-associated Colitis Through Interkingdom Signaling.\r\nGenerally, the NE-QseC axis enhanced the pathogenicity of F. nucleatum through interkingdom signaling to aggravate colonic inflammation in IBD mice. We see that QseC may be a potential target for microbiota management of IBD under chronic pressure.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Time to Inflammatory Bowel Disease Diagnosis for Patients Presenting with Abdominal Symptoms in Primary Care and its Association with Emergency Hospital Admissions and Surgery: A Retrospective Cohort Study.\r\n Longer times to IBD diagnoses were associated with being female, advanced age, obesity, smoking, and Crohn's disease. More IBD-related emergency admissions were observed in patients with a prolonged time to diagnosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Fecal Microbiota Transplantation engraftment after budesonide or placebo in patients with active ulcerative colitis using pre-selected donors: a randomized pilot study.\r\n In this small study, pretreatment with budesonide did not significantly influence engraftment or clinical response after FMT. However, clinical response appeared donor-dependent. Response to FMT may be related to transfer of specific strains instead of overall engraftment, demonstrating the need to characterize mechanisms of actions of strains that maximize therapeutic benefit in ulcerative colitis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMagnetic resonance enterography and intestinal ultrasound for the assessment and monitoring of Crohn's disease.\r\nWe also highlight exciting new developments including the applications of artificial intelligence. Finally, we provide suggestions for future research priorities.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPredictors of symptom trajectory in newly diagnosed ulcerative colitis: a 3-year follow-up cohort study.\r\nBaseline psychological distress is predictive of increased GI symptom severity and reduced mental HRQoL over time, suggesting early assessment of psychological symptoms may identify patients who may have worse disease trajectories. Abdominal pain predicted increased psychological distress, but not the other way around. Intervening on abdominal pain may help prevent or reduce future psychological distress.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    Bariatric surgery post-Liver Transplantation: A Belgian nationwide study.\r\nSG is the favored BS post-LT and has proven to be safe and feasible in a post-LT setting with favorable metabolic consequences. SG post-LT is a valid treatment for de novo and recurrent MASLD post-LT. Although we report on the largest cohort to date, there is still a need for larger cohorts to examine the effect of BS on patient and graft survival.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRecipient hepatectomy technique may affect oncological outcomes of Liver Transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma.\r\nTCR recipient hepatectomy, compared to CS approach, may be associated with some protective effect against post-LT tumor recurrence.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    A real-world analysis of second-line treatment option, Gemcitabine plus Anlotinib and anti-PD1, in advanced pancreatic cancer.\r\n Our data confirms the effectiveness of Gemcitabine plus Anlotinib and anti-PD1 as a well-tolerated regimen in the second-line treatment of APC and extends available data on its use as a second-line treatment option when compared with FOLFIRINOX.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImpact of previous S-1 treatment on efficacy of liposomal irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.\r\nThe efficacy of second-line nal-IRI +5-FU/LV treatment was unaffected by prior S-1 exposure. GS followed by nal-IRI treatment is an alternative treatment sequence for patients with mPDAC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMicroscopic tumor mapping of post-neoadjuvant therapy pancreatic cancer specimens to predict post-surgical recurrence: A prospective cohort study.\r\nMicroscopic tumor mapping of the residual tumor in post-NAT specimens is a significant predictor of post-surgical recurrence, and offers better prognostic performance than the current grading systems.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReconsideration of the clinical impact of neoadjuvant therapy in resectable and borderline resectable pancreatic cancer: A dual-institution collaborative clinical study.\r\nNAT could be unnecessary in patients with tumor size ≤25 mm and CA19-9 < 100 U/mL in resectable disease. In borderline resectable disease, surgery should be delayed until tumor marker levels are well controlled.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    A follow-up from a randomized controlled trial suggests that fish oil in pregnancy may increase the risk of obesity and metabolic syndrome in the offspring-a reason for concern?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNew evidence for efficacy of marine-sourced n-3 fatty acids in postoperative patients.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTaxes to sugar-sweetened beverages: are changes in obesity and diabetes observable?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nUtilizing the gut microbiome as a biomarker of response to dietary interventions in inflammatory bowel disease: moving toward precision nutrition.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    On the Risk of Neurological Disorders in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous\r\nmisc publications eg case reports, tools of the trade, images of\r\nthe month, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Liver Transpl\r\n    Introducing the new controversies in Liver Transplantation Corner.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetters&Replies\r\nLetters to the editors and authors’ replies\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Association Data To Promote Fish And Omega-3 Consumption For Brain Health: Caution Required.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCorrect information on female leadership at the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nVery low-carbohydrate and keto diet increases unhealthy cholesterol.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Reply: On the Risk of Neurological Disorders in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
