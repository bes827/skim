It advocates for early, biomarker-guided, and mechanistically informed sequencing to preserve long-term therapeutic response and overcome the emerging \"therapeutic ceiling.\"\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx The Paradox of NET Involvement in the Pathogenesis of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\nConversely, we consider how inflammation-driven changes in neutrophil activation, phenotype and immunometabolism can cause dysregulation in NET production and clearance and lead to harmful intestinal effects that can prolong intestinal and chronic inflammation in IBD. Specifically, we explore how uncontrolled NET production can damage intestinal epithelial integrity, increase bacterial translocation and increase thromboembolic risk, ultimately linking NETs to the pro-inflammatory pathogenesis of IBD.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx J Crohns Colitis\n    Addition of pulse corticosteroids to oral prednisone in moderately active ulcerative colitis: A randomized, multicentre, open-label study by GETECCU.\nThe addition of three pulses of high-dose corticosteroids to a conventional regimen of oral prednisone does not improve medium and long-term clinical outcomes in moderately active UC.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Automated real-time imaging of intestinal barrier integrity and molecular profiling for early outcome prediction in inflammatory bowel disease - Endo-Histo-Barrier-Omics study.\n Automated advanced imaging enables real-time barrier assessment in IBD and correlates with markers of epithelial and vascular barrier impairment. AI integration can enhance standardization toward broader clinical applicability.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Frequency of dysplasia in endoscopically resected pseudopolyps in inflammatory bowel diseases.\nDysplasia was found in 12% of pseudopolypoid lesions, challenging the assumption that they are uniformly benign. Endoscopic features such as heterogeneous pit pattern and absence of ulceration may aid in identifying high-risk lesions. These results highlight the diagnostic uncertainty surrounding pseudopolyps in IBD and call for careful endoscopic assessment rather than routine resection.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Modified-2-stage versus 3-stage approach in ileoanal pouch surgery for Ulcerative Colitis.\nBoth approaches have comparable high stoma-free rates at the end of follow-up. Modified-2-stage avoids a temporary stoma in more than 75% of patients, but has a significantly higher rate of anastomotic leakages. Active and early surveillance of the anastomosis after 3-stage procedures could improve postoperative outcomes in this group.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Serum Protein Profiles Differ with Adalimumab and Ustekinumab Treatment in Moderately to Severely Active Crohn's Disease.\nAlthough patients receiving either adalimumab or ustekinumab reached similar rates of clinical remission at Week 52, the two therapies resulted in unique serum proteomic expression profiles reflecting mechanistic differences. Long-term treatment data is necessary to understand how differences in therapeutic mechanisms are associated with maintenance of remission and changes in patient reported outcomes in the context of inflammatory biomarkers.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Liver Transpl\n    Associations between socioeconomic factors and post-liver transplant mortality across recovery phases.\nThese findings demonstrate that socioeconomic vulnerability after LT is not fixed but evolves over time. This study introduces a time-resolved framework that identifies when SES factors first become consequential, highlighting actionable windows for targeted interventions to reduce inequities in post-transplant care.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Improved liver transplant outcomes for patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma following implementation of the MMAT-3 policy.\nHowever, although significantly improved, waitlist mortality remained higher in hCCA patients compared to HCC patients (three-year dropout: 17.6% vs 14.%, p=0.02). Under the MMaT policy, hCCA patients have improved access to LT with improved waitlist survival.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Pancreatology\n    Mapping of lymph node metastasis in nonfunctional pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors: A retrospective analysis of 455 patients.\nLymph node metastases are uncommon in pNETs 2 cm, lymphadenectomy should be tailored to metastasis risk at specific stations.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Types of pancreatic lesions and the mutational landscape of the VHL gene in patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease.\n Pancreatic lesions are common in VHL disease.

A Meta-Analysis.\n GLP-1 receptor agonists appear to be safe and effective in patients with IBD.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Comparison of Early Ileocolic Resection and Medical Treatment for Crohn's Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.\n An EICR operation for localized ileocolic CD was associated with longer and more stable remission, resulting in improved long-term outcomes compared to medical therapy alone. In cases of localized ileocolic CD where medical treatment fails to improve disease activity after several months, early surgical intervention may provide a safe and effective way to achieve disease remission and enhance the overall quality of life for patients.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Placebo rates in randomised clinical trials of ulcerative colitis: An individual patient data meta-analysis.\nThese results enable future trials to incorporate design elements that reduce placebo rates as well as a precise benchmark for expected rates in clinical trials that do not include placebo.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Pancreatology\n    Impact of pancreatic steatosis on risk of Post-ERCP pancreatitis: Systematic review and meta-analysis.\nThere was a non-significant trend toward increased odds of severe PEP with PS (OR 2.17, 95 % CI 0.65-7.25;  I 2 = 0 %) CONCLUSIONS: PS appears to be a significant risk factor for the PEP and may help improve risk stratification before ERCP. Nevertheless, further large-scale prospective studies are needed to validate our results.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \n\n\nOriginal articles\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\n\n\n    Am J Clin Nutr\n    Plasma fatty acids and the likelihood of healthy aging: a prospective cohort study.\nRelatively higher levels of plasma PUFAs, including n-3 PUFAs (both DHA and the non-DHA components) and n-6 PUFAs (LA but not the non-LA components), are associated with higher odds of healthy aging, potentially through retarding the biological aging processes.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF URINARY SUGAR TESTING; AN OBSERVATIONAL STUDY OF INTESTINAL PERMEABILITY AND ABSORPTION IN ADULTS AND CHILDREN IN ZAMBIA AND TANZANIA WITH REFERENCE TO MUCOSAL BIOPSIES.\nStatistical analysis was correlational and included linear and fractional polynomial regression models CONCLUSION: LRR does distinguish between healthy and enteropathic states. However, these data suggest that test sugars may al permeate through the intestinal epithelium through common pathways, not necessarily distinguishing between pore, leak or unrestricted pathways or transcellular absorption.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Inflamm Bowel Dis\n    IL-15 Promotes Inflammatory Th17 Cells in the Intestine.\nIL-15 was redundant for Th17 differentiation, but IL-15 could activate terminally differentiated Th17 cells in the colon in a JAK1-dependent manner. Thus, we found that the IL15 axis is upregulated in UC and that IL-15 can activate inflammatory Th17 cells in the colon, raising the possibility that IL-15 is a potential target for UC treatments.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Reliability and Validity of Mesenteric Fat Assessment by Intestinal Ultrasound in Pediatric Crohn's Disease Using the Chicago Mesenteric Fat Index.\n Assessment of MF on IUS is reproducible and reliable in pediatric CD. The CMFI can be used as a biomarker that mirrors biochemical and sonographic indicators of pediatric CD activity.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx The Importance of Treatment Timing and Positioning in IBD.\nThis commentary examines the progressive decline in biologic efficacy in inflammatory bowel disease, highlighting pharmacologic, immunologic, and cellular mechanisms of resistance.
