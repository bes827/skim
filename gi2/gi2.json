The guideline is a joint project of the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization (ECCO), the European Society of Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiology, the European Society of Pathology, and the International Bowel Ultrasonography Group under the leadership of ECCO.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeta-analysis\r\nmeta-analyses and systematic reviews\r\n\r\n\r\n    Liver Transpl\r\n    Incidence and risk factors for skin cancer in liver transplant recipients: A systematic review.\r\nThis study was limited by the heterogeneity of the study population, methods, and definitions of skin cancer. Overall, liver transplant recipients face heightened long-term risks of NMSCs, and while key risk factors are well established, there remains a gap in skin cancer surveillance and patient education within this population.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Circulating Bile Acids, Bile Acids Receptor Polymorphisms, and Risk of Chronic Kidney Disease among Individuals with Newly Diagnosed Type 2 Diabetes: A Prospective Study.\r\n Among adults with T2D, higher concentrations of most circulating PBAs and total unconjugated SBAs were linearly associated with higher a risk of CKD, and genetic variations in FXR modified the association of unconjugated SBAs with CKD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDietary patterns and risk of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias across five racial and ethnic groups in the Multiethnic Cohort Study. \r\nHealthy dietary patterns in mid- to late-life and improvement in older age were associated with a reduced risk of ADRD in a diverse population. The racial and ethnic heterogeneity in the relationships observed warrants further study.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInvestigating the impact of body weight changes and blood lipids on the risk for mild cognitive impairment in Parkinson´s disease; a prospective cohort study.\r\nHigh risk for MCI in patients with PD at the time of diagnosis was associated with low levels of P-TG and an interaction between change in BMI and P-TG before diagnosis, suggesting that nutritional factors have complex influence on cognitive function in the prodromal stage of PD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nModelled impacts of substituting meat and dairy with plant-based substitutes on the risk of nutrient deficiency and chronic disease mortality: a microsimulation study in French adults.\r\n As modeled, full substitution of animal products with PBS would result in limited increases in deficiency risk, and decreases in chronic disease mortality, with meat replacement providing most of the benefits. Expected effects vary widely depending on the nutritional quality of the substitutes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Interplay of Nutritional Status and Physical Function on Health Outcomes in Older Adults: A Longitudinal Study in Singapore.\r\nBoth nutritional status and physical function are independently and interactively associated with health outcomes in older adults. These findings underscore the need for integrated interventions targeting both nutritional status and physical function to promote healthy aging and reduce frailty. Future research should explore the mediating role of physical function and evaluate strategies to optimize health outcomes in older adults.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe regulation of fatty acid mobilization is extravagant rather than frugal - a perspective indicating a limitation of the thrifty genotype hypothesis.\r\nExperimental evidence suggests that a rising plasma FFA level worsens insulin resistance, and conversely, making FFA mobilization thriftier (slowing FFA mobilization) improves insulin sensitivity. It is concluded that fatty acid trafficking is inherently unthrifty, and that this lavish approach for regulating fat metabolism contributes to the high incidence of pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Efficacy and Safety of Ustekinumab and Vedolizumab for Crohn's Disease of the Pouch.\r\nIn one of the largest cohorts evaluating UST and VDZ for CD of the pouch thus far, these biologics were found to be safe and effective treatments for CD of the pouch.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPreferences, Acceptability, and Utilization of Multimodal Self-Help Interventions in Adults With Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: A Pragmatic Multicenter Study With Patients and Clinicians.\r\nFew patients with IBD use self-help resources, even though the majority regard multimodal self-help resources as acceptable and feasible to get information, find community and support, and manage living with IBD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    A novel, institutionally developed hypothermic oxygenated machine PErfusion system allows low-cost, universal implementation for liver transplantation: A safety and feasibility pilot study.\r\nThe total cost of the COARO system is US$1,494.87 per LT, 80% cheaper than a commercial equivalent. The COARO system is safe and presents significant economic advantage over commercial systems, allowing universal implementation of HOPE for al LT procedures in under resourced units.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreas\r\n    Ancient and Modern History of Pancreatic Surgery.\r\nIn parallel, surgery for pancreatic adenocarcinoma was completed since the 90s by adjuvant chemotherapy then by neodadjuvant treatments, allowing more resections with a more favorable prognosis. More recently, islet cell transplantation, an alternative to pancreatic transplantation, and minimally invasive surgery have expanded the possibilities of less aggressive pancreatic surgery.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMolecular Characterization of Pancreatic Simple Mucinous Cysts with GNAS Mutation: A Case Report and Literature Review. \r\nSMC should be considered a differential diagnosis of pancreatic cystic lesions.

The risk of colectomy remains substantial after discharge despite low in-hospital colectomy rate following an episode of ASUC. Initial steroid response did not affect long-term colectomy rate at 12 months.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEfficacy and Safety of Upadacitinib Maintenance Therapy in Patients with Moderately to Severely Active Crohn's Disease: 2-Year Results from the U-ENDURE Long-Term Extension Study.\r\n Sustained clinical, endoscopic, quality-of-life, and biomarker outcomes were observed in patients who were initial responders to upadacitinib and completed 2 years of maintenance therapy, with no new safety signals identified. Clinical trial identifier U-ENDURE;  ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03345823.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSpatiotemporal analysis of Crohn's disease reveals PECAM2 signaling at the basis of inflammation-to-fibrosis transition.\r\nOur results provide insights into CD38-driven fibrosis and indicate that PECAM2 signaling blockade could reduce the development of strictures in patients with Crohn's disease, potentially offering a new treatment target.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    A novel, institutionally developed hypothermic oxygenated machine PErfusion system allows low-cost, universal implementation for liver transplantation: A safety and feasibility pilot study.\r\nThe total cost of the COARO system is US$1,494.87 per LT, 80% cheaper than a commercial equivalent. The COARO system is safe and presents significant economic advantage over commercial systems, allowing universal implementation of HOPE for al LT procedures in under resourced units.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCognitive dysfunction, psychiatric distress, and functional decline after liver transplantation.\r\nBelow-expectation cognition was prevalent among 25% of liver recipients at least 1 year after transplant and was associated with a higher likelihood of reporting psychiatric distress. These findings underscore the need for longitudinal assessment of cognitive and mental health outcomes among recipients of liver transplants.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreas\r\n    Significance of Pancreatic Steatosis as a Predictor of New-Onset Diabetes Mellitus Following Pancreatectomy.\r\nPreoperative remP/S ratio and HbA1c were significant predictors of NODMP, enabling the effective stratification of NODMP risk and facilitating the early treatment of the disease.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    Predictors of acute pancreatitis in patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists for weight management.\r\n A history of gallstone disease, history of AP, CAD/PVD, and tobacco use were associated with AP after initiation of GLP-1RA for obesity treatment. A higher BMI appears to be protective against AP. Recognizing factors associated AP after GLP-1RA initiation can inform clinicians on risk stratification.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Biomarkers for individualized nutritional therapy in disease-related malnutrition: A narrative review.\r\nIt is crucial to use biomarkers to distinguish etiology at an individual level when implementing nutritional treatment interventions. The key challenge ahead is to determine the most effective way to incorporate these biomarkers into established assessment tools, optimizing personalized nutritional care for patients with malnutrition.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Breaking Conventions: Innovative Reflections on the Medication Use Research of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Adults and the Elderly.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nComment On: Predictors of Complicated Disease Course in Children and Adults With Ulcerative Colitis: A Nationwide Study From the epi-IIRN.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Comparison of the FDA and EMA guidance on drug development in ulcerative colitis: an expert panel review.\r\nHarmonizing FDA and EMA guidelines is essential to streamline global IBD clinical trials, reduce redundancies, and improve patient outcomes. Recommendations include adopting less invasive assessments, standardizing remission definitions, and prioritizing patient-centered endpoints. These measures could reduce trial complexity, increase inclusivity, and accelerate the development of effective therapies for UC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nPancreatology\r\n    Fragments of Truth: AI-nCLE and the Mirage of Universal Benefit.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGlucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) and acute pancreatitis.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous\r\nmisc publications eg case reports, tools of the trade, images of\r\nthe month, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Inflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Mucosal Responses to Type II Interferon in IBD.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    Calcium in your arteries: Abdominal, coronary, or both to predict post-LT MACE?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCenters for medicare and medicaid's new transplant program requirements may unintentionally limit access'.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nComparative analyses of anastomosis methods for dual portal vein right lobe grafts in living donor liver transplantation: A retrospective study.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFellows' Corner.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    Comparative efficacy of paracetamol and tramadol for pain management in acute pancreatitis: A double-blinded randomized study.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nComparison of early and delayed intervention for symptomatic acute necrotizing pancreatitis: Need for Re-intervention and clinical outcomes.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetters&Replies\r\nLetters to the editors and authors’ replies\r\n\r\n\r\n    Inflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    REPLY: Breaking Conventions: Innovative Reflections on the Medication Use Research of IBD in Adults and the Elderly.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Such research will help guide resource allocation and improve IBD management in these settings.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    International Association of Pancreatology Revised Guidelines on Acute Pancreatitis 2025.\r\n The recommendations presented here should serve as an evidence-based resource for practicing physicians and caregivers to treat patients with AP more effectively. In addition, the guidelines identify areas for future research, mainly targeted therapies for controlling systemic inflammation and mitigating organ dysfunction.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeta-analysis\r\nmeta-analyses and systematic reviews\r\n\r\n\r\n    J Crohns Colitis\r\n    A Network Meta-analysis of Capsule Endoscopy Versus Imaging Modalities for Diagnosing Small Bowel Crohn's Disease.\r\nVCE exhibited superior diagnostic performance for detecting established proximal SB-CD compared to other imaging modalities. Clinicians should weigh the benefits and risks, and incorporate other modalities, such as MRE and IUS to optimize diagnosis and management.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nScoring indices for assessing endoscopic disease activity in acute severe ulcerative colitis: A systematic review.\r\nThese results highlight the need for a validated endoscopic score that can accurately describe and quantify the severity of endoscopic lesions and potentially predict outcomes in ASUC patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    Survivorship interventions after liver transplantation (LT): A systematic review of interventions targeting physical and psychosocial wellbeing after LT. \r\nThere is limited data on promoting post-LT education, as well as social work and caregiver interventions. Future research should consider these areas for study;  high quality interventions need to incorporate stakeholder input, target later LT survivorship stages, and apply consistent definitions of patient-centered outcomes using validated measures.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Association between habitual adherence to the planetary-health diet and mortality and major chronic disease risk among UK Biobank participants.\r\nOur results point towards an inverse association between habitual adherence to the PHD and all-cause mortality and cancer risk, although the associations with cancer depended on the cancer type. Our study provides additional evidence that sustainable diets can improve human health.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDietary diversity as a modifier of the effect of supplementation with multiple micronutrients during pregnancy on low birth weight in a randomized controlled trial in Bangladesh.\r\nIn rural Bangladesh, where maternal dietary diversity was generally low, MMS (compared to IFA) supplementation had the strongest effect on reducing low birth weight among pregnant females with the least diverse diet, possibly reflecting the additional benefit of supplementation in this vulnerable group. Clinicaltrials Gov identifier NCT00860470.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHeterogeneity in the association between a dietary pattern high in fat, sugar, and sodium and adverse pregnancy outcomes by maternal characteristics: a US pregnancy cohort study.\r\nThis work may provide clues that contribute to a deeper understanding of the heterogeneity in dietary responses in pregnancy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Value of an Ecological Approach to Address Micronutrient Malnutrition.\r\nWe present a conceptual framework for applying this ecological perspective with foci on: 1) How to apply this approach to assessments that capture the complexity of the nutritional ecology;  and 2) How to expand he understanding of the biology of MNs in biological systems and the environmental factors that influence them. Suggestions are included for a targeted clinical, public health and research agenda to inform the development of context-specific, nutritional assessment and interventions.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Endoscopic Recurrence in Crohn's Disease Patients With Long-Term Ileostomy.\r\nIn this retrospective study, 77.3% of ileostomy patients underwent endoscopic assessment during follow-up. Ileal recurrence was detected in 39.7% of patients who underwent endoscopic evaluation. Patients with ileal involvement or preoperative exposure to biologics had the highest risk of recurrence. These patients might benefit from endoscopic monitoring. Fecal calprotectin is a reliable noninvasive marker for detecting ileal inflammation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGroup-Delivered Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy to Reduce Psychological Distress and Improve Sleep in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: A Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial (MindIBD).\r\nMindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy can be considered a valuable addition to the limited effective psychosocial interventions set for IBD patients, as it reduces psychological distress and improves well-being. This study also shows the possible impact of MBCT on biological processes, such as sleep and inflammation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIsolated Anastomotic Ulcers Are Associated with a Higher Long-Term Risk for Postoperative Recurrence and a Differential Mucosa-Associated Microbiome Composition in Patients with Crohn's Disease Following Ileocolic Resection.\r\nIAUs in CD patients with otherwise healthy neo-TI at first postoperative ileocolonoscopy are associated with long-term POR. In addition, a differential mucosa-associated microbiome composition was observed in patients with IAUs, specifically the proteobacteria Klebsiella, suggesting that putative taxa are related to these lesions. Further validation studies in larger cohorts, along with mechanistic studies, are still required.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential and risk of incident Crohn's disease-a prospective cohort study.\r\nCHIP was associated with a markedly increased risk of subsequent CD. The association was particularly stronger in JAK2-mutant CHIP, ASXL1-mutant CHIP, and DNMT3A-mutant CHIP. The findings of this study may offer potential insights for future investigations into the mechanistic underpinnings of CD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMirikizumab impact on disease clearance in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis: analysis of a pre-specified LUCENT trial endpoint.\r\nMirikizumab consistently demonstrated disease clearance across induction, maintenance, and long-term studies. The attainment of disease clearance was associated with greater improvement in PROs, and early achievement of disease clearance was associated with better long-term outcomes, including clinical remission, corticosteroid-free remission, endoscopic and histological outcomes, reduced stool frequency, and rectal bleeding.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSusceptibility to inflammatory bowel diseases promotes invasive carcinomas in a murine model of ATF6-driven colon cancer.\r\n Our findings show that IBD susceptibility heightens the risk for ATF6-driven tumorigenesis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    Geographic variation in utilization of deceased donor livers in the United States in the era of advanced perfusion.\r\nOn adjusted analysis, candidates in LUCs had lower likelihood of transplant (HR=0.88, p <0.001) but also lower waitlist mortality (HR=0.95, p <0.001). The advent of advanced perfusion was associated with utilization of otherwise marginal liver allografts and ameliorating geographic imbalances in discard seen with successive allocation policy eras.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMachine learning improves post-transplantation hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence prediction.\r\nWe developed a novel ML model that outperforms a widely used post-transplantation HCC recurrence risk score. This model may be used to better risk stratify patients following transplantation and tailor surveillance/adjuvant therapy. The pre-transplantation ML model may be used with the Milan Criteria to further risk stratify patients being considered for transplantation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRisk factors for in-hospital postoperative complications and 6-month graft survival after liver transplantation: A multicenter cohort study. \r\nIn conclusion, postoperative complications, such as graft dysfunction, AKI and severe complications, were frequent after LT. We identified risk factors, such as donor and graft characteristics, MELD 3.0 and preoperative requirement for organ support, that may inform transplant risk evaluation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSteatotic liver disease is the dominant indication for liver transplantation in both europe and the United States: Trends and outcomes in the past two decades. \r\n(all p 1.0, p<0.01), similar between ELTR and SRTR, in patients without and with HCC. ALD and NASH/MASH are now leading indications for liver transplantation in two large global regions.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe cirrhosis-hospital frailty risk score predicts mortality in patients with chronic liver disease: Analysis of a nationally representative database. \r\nAmong patients with cirrhosis, the cHFRS demonstrated superior prediction of in-hospital mortality, compared to the original HFRS score.
