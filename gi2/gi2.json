More randomised evidence is required to overcome the \"HPB surgeon's paranoia\".\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Cross-sectional associations between consumption of non-nutritive sweeteners and diet quality among U.S. adults in the Cancer Prevention Study-3.\r\nNNS consumers had lower diet quality in a large cohort of U.S. adults.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDietary patterns and risk of multiple cancers: umbrella review of meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies.\r\n These findings suggest that adherence to certain healthy dietary patterns is associated with lower risk of al cancers and certain individual cancers. Register This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023425237). crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.php?RecordID=425237.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEffect of a 12-month intervention with whey protein powder on cognitive function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment: a randomized controlled trial.\r\nSupplementation with whey protein powder rich in MFGM, taurine, and B vitamins for 12-month improved cognitive function in older adults with MCI.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInfant body composition trajectories differ by in utero exposure to gestational diabetes mellitus: a prospective cohort from birth to 12 months.\r\nIn a cohort of infants exposed and unexposed to GDM in utero, infants exposed had increased weight, FM, and percent body fat at birth. However, more infants exposed to GDM had less fat accrual over the first year of life, compared with those unexposed. The long-term effects of these growth patterns in the first year challenge current concepts and support further investigation of neonatal body composition.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMaternal vitamin D status, fetal growth patterns, and adverse pregnancy outcomes in a multi-site prospective pregnancy cohort.\r\nFirst trimester 25(OH)D was positively associated with linear growth. Low first trimester 25(OH)D (<40 nmol/L) was associated with higher risk for preterm birth. Second trimester 25(OH)D was not associated with fetal growth or pregnancy outcomes assessed.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe effect of an intervention to reduce aflatoxin consumption from 6 to 18 months of age on length-for-age Z-scores in rural Tanzania: a cluster-randomized trial.\r\n and conclusions An intervention to reduce AF exposure did not alter AF-alb nor anthropometric measures between treatment groups. Drought and agricultural data indicated less favorable conditions for toxin production, resulting in low levels of exposure in both trial arms. Annual, seasonal, and geographic heterogeneity of AF contamination make it difficult to study in an ethically-designed trial. Our formative research and early trial data indicate that stunting and intermittent AF exposure continue to be a problem in this area. However, the low AF exposure levels during the trial led to inconclusive results.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 Receptor Agonists Are Not Associated With an Increased Risk of Ileus or Intestinal Obstruction in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease-A Danish Nationwide Cohort Study.\r\n This study suggests that GLP-1RAs do not increase the risk of ileus or intestinal obstruction in patients with IBD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nUndetected Dysplasia at Colectomy in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.

Targeted dietary interventions are welcome for young people who leave their parental home early or do not enter a structured school or workplace environment and for addressing sex differences in diet quality associated with family-related life transitions.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nComputer vision-assisted dietary assessment through mobile phones in female youth in urban Ghana: validity against weighed records and comparison with 24-h recalls.\r\nFRANI-assisted dietary assessment accurately estimates nutrient intake and performed as accurately as 24HR in female youth in Ghana. Although improvements in computer vision-assisted diet assessment are possible, emerging evidence on FRANI suggests its readiness for scale-up.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCross-context equivalence and agreement of healthy diet metrics for national and global monitoring: a multicountry analysis of cross-sectional quantitative 24-hour dietary intake studies.\r\n Composite metrics weighting both healthy and unhealthy food groups have limited cross-context equivalence, because a wide range of diets can theoretically return similar scores. Healthy food group (sub)metrics performed comparably, likely indicating strong underlying construct validity (i.e., dietary diversity and nutrient adequacy). For national and global monitoring, refinement and validation of unhealthy food group metrics (i.e., moderation) is recommended to complement healthy food group metrics.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDiet quality during pregnancy, adolescent brain morphology, and cognitive performance in a population-based cohort.\r\nDiet quality during pregnancy was associated with structural brain alterations in the offspring, which partly explained the relation between prenatal dietary patterns and cognitive outcomes in children.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEvaluating the connection between diet quality, EpiNutrient intake and epigenetic age: an observational study.\r\nOur findings corroborate the hypothesis that nutrition plays a pivotal role in influencing epigenetic homeostasis, especially DNAm, thereby contributing to individual health trajectories and the pace of aging.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLongitudinal evaluation of iron status during pregnancy: a prospective cohort study in a high-resource setting.\r\nMethods In a prospective cohort of primiparous women with low-risk, singleton pregnancies in Ireland, iron [ferritin, soluble transferrin receptors (sTfR), total body iron (TBI)] and inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, α-glycoprotein) were measured at 3 study visits: 15, 20, and 33 wk of gestation. Women with anemia (hemoglobin 60 μg/L.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    Management of portal vein thrombosis in liver transplant candidates.\r\nWhile the feasibility of TIPS placement diminished with the presence of portal cavernoma or chronic portal vein thrombosis, the introduction of novel interventional radiological techniques to recanalize the portal venous axis through transplenic, transmesenteric and/or transhepatic routes is revolutionizing this landscape. These advancements achieve TIPS placement and recanalization in 90-100% of patients, warranting consideration in cirrhotic patients with chronic PVT for whom LT would otherwise be contraindicated or when physiological anastomosis is not feasible.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOutcomes following use of hepatitis B surface antigen positive liver allografts in hepatitis B surface antigen negative recipients.\r\nKaplan-Meier survival analysis showed no difference in survival when compared to al other liver transplants performed at the institution during the same period (p=0.5, HR=1.6, CI=0.4-6.5). Based on these findings, the use of HBsAg+ liver donors appears to be safe;  however, continued follow-up is required to understand further risks associated with the use of HBsAg+ liver allografts.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe impact of recipient hypernatremia on pediatric liver transplantation outcomes.\r\nCorrected hypernatremia resulted in decreased mortality compared to uncorrected hypernatremia. Recipient hypernatremia is an important indicator of disease processes and a predictor of poor post-transplantation mortality outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Artificial intelligence-assisted mobile dietary assessment: time to expand the standard toolkit?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCapturing life transitions to elevate the value of examining dietary trajectories.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDefining a healthy diet globally: The good, the bad, and the ugly.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFinally, a quality prospective study to support a proactive paradigm in anemia of pregnancy.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFrom mom's diet to child's big brain: in search of brain-optimal pregnancy diets.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInterrupting transgenerational programming of infant mortality risk: evidence from a multigeneration cohort study in Sweden.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    Early detection of pancreatic cancer: Study design and analytical considerations in biomarker discovery and early phase validation studies. \r\nMultisite and multidisciplinary collaboration can facilitate study design strategies in this lethal but low incidence disease and streamline the path from biomarker discovery to clinical use. Improvements in analytical and experimental design methods could help accelerate biomarker evaluation through the phases of biomarker development.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous\r\nmisc publications eg case reports, tools of the trade, images of\r\nthe month, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Liver Transpl\r\n    Mapping new mechanisms: Hypothermic oxygenated perfusion attenuates the immune response after human liver transplantation.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSociodemographic disparities in downstaging to liver transplant for hepatocellular carcinoma.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetters&Replies\r\nLetters to the editors and authors’ replies\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Carbon isotope ratio is not a viable candidate biomarker for total added sugar intake.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    Aspirin use and the risk of pancreatic cancer.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Future studies would benefit from prospective data collection incorporating standardized symptomatic, endoscopic, and histologic indices. Ultimately, a well-powered RCT is needed to better assess the effectiveness, safety, and durability of OV therapy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Adaptive changes in multiple aspects of emotion regulation in the offspring of pregnant persons receiving a diet-and-exercise intervention relative to usual pregnancy care: A randomized controlled trial.\r\nThis intervention was associated with medium/large effect size improvements in offspring ER. Larger trials are needed to confirm the potential of these interventions on offspring neurodevelopment. Clinical trial registry NCT01689961, Sept 21, 2012.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAdulthood dietary and lifestyle patterns and risk of breast cancer: Global Cancer Update Programme (CUP Global) systematic literature review.\r\nAdvice to adopt combined aspects of a healthy diet and lifestyle according to WCRF/AICR and ACS scores, encouraging a healthy weight, physical activity, alcohol and smoking avoidance, and a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, (whole)grains and cereals and discouraging red and processed meat, can be proposed to females to lower BC risk. This review was registered at PROSPERO as ID CRD42021270129 ( on 28 August, 2021, and further updated on 4 May, 2022, in order to extend the search period.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nBlood Biomarkers of Trans-Fatty Acid Intake among Nigerian Adults in the Federal Capital Territory: A Cross-Sectional Study.\r\nThese results provide a baseline assessment of TFA exposure in Nigerian adults to evaluate implementation and effect of national regulation passed in 2023. The observed subgroup differences may help identify subpopulations for targeted interventions to reduce TFA intake.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHuman milk feeding practices and serum immune profiles of one-year-old infants in the CHILD birth cohort study.\r\nCurrent HMF status and (to a lesser extent) HMF history are associated with several inflammation-associated biomarkers in one-year-old infants. These results provide new evidence that HMF impacts immune activity and development and suggest hypotheses about the underlying mechanisms. They also highlight the importance of including current HMF status in immune-system-focused infant serum proteomic studies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nUltra-processed food consumption is associated with the acceleration of biological aging in the Moli-sani Study.\r\nA diet rich in UPF was associated with an acceleration of biological aging in a large sample of Italian adults. The poor nutritional composition of highly processed foods weakly accounted for this association, suggesting that biological aging could be adversely influenced by nonnutrient characteristics of these foods.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Assessment of Treatment Response in Known Crohn's Disease-A Prospective Blinded Study Comparing the Diagnostic Accuracy of Intestinal Ultrasound, Magnetic Resonance Enterocolonography, Panenteric Capsule Endoscopy, and Fecal Calprotectin.\r\nIUS and FC are equally effective for determining treatment response in patients with active CD. PCE is limited by the occurrence of strictures in this group of patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nComparative Effectiveness of Ozanimod and Vedolizumab as First-Line Advanced Therapies in Ulcerative Colitis: A Propensity-Matched Cohort Analysis.\r\nOur real-world study showed that ozanimod use is associated with similar corticosteroid use but higher odds of a change in therapy compared to vedolizumab when used as first-line therapy in patients with UC. Further prospective studies are needed to understand long-term outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Clinical Interpretation of Cluster Trials.\r\nHowever, cluster trials are logistically complex to implement and have unique vulnerabilities that must be evaluated for accurate interpretation. Here, we provide a general overview of the design and statistical issues in cluster trials to facilitate their interpretation by clinicians.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Characterisation of IBD heterogeneity using serum proteomics: A multicentre study.\r\n Our findings in serum proteins support the presence of a continuous IBD spectrum rather than a clear separation of CD and UC. Within the spectrum, disease location may reflect a more similar disease than CD vs UC, as colonic CD resembled UC more closely than ileal CD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEffectiveness of transitional care in Inflammatory Bowel Disease; Development, Validation, and Initial outcomes of a Transition Success Score.\r\nThe Transition Success Score serves as a quantitative tool to evaluate the effectiveness of transitional care interventions and to identify inflammatory bowel disease patients at risk of encountering challenges during the transition to adult healthcare.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImpact of histological remission for predicting clinical relapse in Crohn's disease: a post-hoc analysis of the prospective STORI cohort.\r\n Despite correlations with endoscopy and biomarkers, histological scores did not predict clinical relapse in CD patients in remission. Thus, these scores are not recommended for clinical practice to assess relapse risk in CD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLabour market participation and income in patients with IBD onset before young adulthood - the role of disease severity and mental health.\r\n Patients with IBD more often had low LMP, but their income was not affected. The subgroup of patients with severe disease and mental health conditions had the highest risk of low LMP.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRisankizumab Is Associated With Normalization of Biomarkers in Patients With Crohn's Disease: Results From the Phase 3 ADVANCE, MOTIVATE, and FORTIFY Studies.\r\nRisankizumab treatment led to sustained normalization of inflammatory biomarkers with improved clinical and endoscopic results.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    Rs1347093 regulates microRNA-216/-217 expression and is associated with pancreatic cancer risk.\r\nThis study may reveal the biological relevance underlying rs1347093-A allele with an increase in pancreatic cancer risk. SNP rs1347093 could be meaningful as a novel biomarker for pancreatic cancer risk.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTiming of lumen-apposing metal stents removal in pancreatic fluid collections: Could we go beyond?\r\nPrimary aim is to evaluate the AEs rate in patients with LAMS removal 4 weeks appears to be as safe as LAMS removal within 4 weeks. LAMS ≥15 mm and Head location were associated with higher rate of AE and thus should arouse more caution.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous\r\nmisc publications eg case reports, tools of the trade, images of\r\nthe month, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Inflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Symptomatic and Sonographic Improvement of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Enterocolitis With Risankizumab.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    Have CFTR modulators changed the need for liver and lung transplantation among patients with cystic fibrosis?
