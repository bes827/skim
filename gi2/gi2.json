The larger GCV following UHT-M suggests that gastric volume may poorly predict circulating nutrient appearance from complex food matrices. Dairy heat treatment may be an effective tool to modify nutrient release by impacting digestion kinetics.

Healthcare providers should be aware about the deleterious potential of specific antibiotic groups in patients with IBD only using these agents in a restrictive manner or preferentially consider alternative antibiotic groups.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe phospholipid flippase ATP8B1 is involved in the pathogenesis of Ulcerative Colitis via establishment of intestinal barrier function.\r\n ATP8B1 is important in the establishment of the intestinal barrier Downregulation of ATP8B1 levels in UC, and subsequent altered localization of tight junctional proteins, including CLDN4, might therefore be an important mechanism in UC pathophysiology.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThiopurine metabolite shunting in late pregnancy increases the risk of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy in women with inflammatory bowel disease, and can be managed with split-dosing.\r\nThiopurine exposure is associated with an increased risk of ICP, particularly following dose increases antenatally and with shunting in late pregnancy. The latter may be effectively managed with split dosing, although further studies are warranted.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreas\r\n    Serum Carbohydrate Antigen 19-9 and Metabolite Hypotaurine Are Predictive Markers for Early Recurrence of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.\r\nOur results suggested that tumor hypotaurine is a potential metabolite associated with early recurrence.

As patients with high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia at the pancreatic transection margin have an increased risk of recurrence in the remnant pancreas, careful postoperative follow-up is required.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCommunication, understanding and engagement of patients with pancreatic cancer at time of diagnosis.\r\n In this first attempt to measure clarity of communication and engagement in patients with PDAC, typical features of conversation and problematic understanding emerged, which deserves further investigation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFactors affecting the time interval of endoscopic ultrasound-guided endoscopic necrosectomy of walled-off pancreatic necrosis: A retrospective single-center study in China.\r\nThe EUS-measured solid necrotic ratio, the MCTSI, postoperative fever, C-reactive protein increase, and fever before reintervention in patients affect the time interval of EUS-guided endoscopic necrosectomy in WON patients. These five indicators may be promisingly effective in predicting and managing endoscopic necrosectomy intervals.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTumor location, clinicopathological features, and perioperative and prognostic outcomes in patients who underwent pancreatic resection following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for resectable pancreatic cancer: A retrospective study.\r\nThe prognoses based on tumor locations in the Ph and Pbt after surgery following NACRT are similar.
