In contrast, there was no further decrease in the probability of first major resective surgery after the immunosuppressive era.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nUpadacitinib Salvage Therapy for Infliximab experienced patients with Acute Severe Ulcerative Colitis.\r\nUpadacitinib may have a role as a safe and effective salvage therapy for steroid-refractory ASUC in patients who have previously failed to respond to infliximab therapy. Prospective studies are required to determine the safety and efficacy of upadacitinib use in this setting before routine use can be recommended.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    Atherosclerosis on CT coronary angiography and risk of long-term cardiovascular events post liver transplantation.\r\n The standardized CAD-RADS classification on CTCA predicted the occurrence of cardiovascular outcomes following LT, with a potential to increase utilization of preventive cardiovascular therapies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFeasibility of steroid-free tacrolimus-basiliximab immunosuppression in pediatric liver transplantation and predictors for steroid requirement.\r\nBasiliximab induction in combination with tacrolimus-based treatment avoided steroid requirement in 45% of the patients. Tacrolimus variability and trough levels below 6.4 ng/mL independently increased the risk of steroid requirement. Further efforts should be focused on personalizing immunosuppressive treatment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInhibition of SK2 and ER Stress ameliorated inflammation and apoptosis in liver ischemia reperfusion injury.\r\nTaken together, our results suggested that ER stress and SK2 played important and regulatory roles in hepatic IRI. Inhibition of ER stress and SK2 could significantly improve liver function after hepatic IRI.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver transplant outcomes using late allocation grafts.\r\nDespite additional logistical complexity and longer CIT, LT outcomes utilizing LA grafts are similar to those allocated via SA. Improving allocation policies specific to LA offers, as well as the sharing of best practices between transplant centers and OPOs, are opportunities to further help minimize unnecessary discards.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNational survey of second opinions for hospitalized patients in need of liver transplantation.\r\nPractices and perceptions of second opinions for hospitalized patients evaluated for LT varied widely across the US. Opportunities exist to improve equity in LT but must consider maintaining individual program autonomy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    A mouse model for high-efficient Flp-recombinase-mediated genetic manipulation in the pancreas.\r\nWe have generated a new transgenic mouse line expressing FLPo, which enables highly efficient pancreatic-specific gene recombination.

Am J Clin Nutr 2023; xx xx-xx.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMetabolizable energy content of breastmilk supports normal growth in exclusively breastfed Icelandic infants to age 6 months.\r\nThe evidence from this study confirms that when mothers are motivated and supported without economic restraints, breastmilk intake and the energy supplied by breastmilk to EBF infants at 6 mo of age is sufficient to support normal growth patterns. There was no evidence of constraint on FFM, and other studies show that high FM in EBF infants is likely to be transient. These data further support the recommendation for EBF =6 mo of age for body composition.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe dietary requirement for total sulphur amino acids in adults =60 years appears higher in males than in females.1,2.\r\nThese findings are important given recommendations for increased plant protein consumption.

Over half of IBD patients in India were seropositive prior to vaccination. These insights can help to inform shielding advice, therapeutic choices, and vaccine strategies in IBD patients for COVID-19 and future viral challenges.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReal-world Evidence Comparing Tofacitinib and Vedolizumab in Anti-TNF-experienced Patients With Ulcerative Colitis.\r\n Ulcerative colitis patients with prior anti-TNF experience initiating tofacitinib demonstrated lower treatment persistence compared with those initiating vedolizumab. This finding is in contrast to other recent studies suggesting superior effectiveness of tofacitinib. Ultimately, head-to-head randomized, controlled trials that focus on directly measured end points may be needed to best inform clinical practice.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Gut microbiome generated phenylacetylglutamine from dietary protein is associated with Crohn's Disease and exacerbates colitis in mouse model possibly via platelet activation.\r\n Taken together, ppdc-carrying Proteobacteria generated PAGln from dietary protein is associated with CD and exacerbates colitis possibly via platelet-induced coagulation and inflammation These results suggest that PAGln is a potential early diagnostic marker and therapeutic target of CD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMyeloid cell specific deletion of PDGFR-a promotes dysbiotic intestinal microbiota and thus increased colitis susceptibility.\r\nTaken together, our results indicate a protective role for myeloid PDGFR-a in maintaining gut homeostasis by promoting a protective intestinal microbiota and providing an anti-inflammatory macrophage phenotype.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    A randomized, controlled, prehabilitation intervention to maximize early recovery (PRIMER) in liver transplantation.\r\n A home-based intervention with financial incentives and text-based nudges was feasible, highly accepted and increased daily steps in LT candidates with functional impairment and malnutrition.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSex and racial disparities in live donor liver transplantation in the united states.\r\nIn the LDLT population, significant disparities exist with respect to sex and race that disadvantage women, but these disparities are less pronounced than in the DDLT population. Complex clinical and socioeconomic differences as well as donor factors may explain these variations, though further studies are needed.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTreatment of donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies-mediated rejection after liver transplantation: A French nationwide retrospective study.\r\nAfter a median follow-up of 21 months (range: 12-107), DSA became undetectable in 15/38 patients (39.5%) with available DSA monitoring. In conclusion, specific treatment of AMR in LT recipients has slowly emerged in France during the past decade and has probably been considered in the most severe patients;  this explains the global poor outcome, even if the outcome was favorable in some cases.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreas\r\n    Breakthrough Symptoms Remain an Unmet Need in Symptomatic Patients With Neuroendocrine Tumors and Carcinoid Syndrome.\r\nBreakthrough symptoms remain an unmet need, even in treated patients with NETs.
