After 4 years, the LI appeared to be stable and the IBD-DI decreased, with no correlation between the 2 indexes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDurability of the First Biologic in Children and Adults With Ulcerative Colitis: A Nationwide Study from the epi-IIRN.\r\n After 5 years of treatment, 43% of the patients with UC sustained their first biologic, with similar durability in pediatric and adult-onset onset disease. Anti-TNFs had similar durability to vedolizumab and superior durability when prescribed as combotherapy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInequalities in Healthcare Access, Experience and Outcomes in Adults With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Scoping Review.\r\nFurther research, particularly utilizing qualitative methods, is needed to understand health experiences of underserved patient populations with IBD. Cultural humility in IBD care is required to better serve individuals with IBD of Black and Asian race/ethnicity. The lack of research amongst sexual and gender minority groups with IBD, and with learning disabilities, poses a risk of creating inequalities within inequalities.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIntestinal Stromal Cells in the Turmoil of Inflammation and Defective Connective Tissue Remodeling in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\nCurrent IBD treatments target inflammation but fail in fibrostenotic or fistulizing disease.

PROSPERO registration number  CRD42021233309.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Inter- and Intraobserver Variability on Endoscopic Scoring Systems in Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.\r\nThe interobserver agreement rates for eMS, UCEIS, CDEIS, and SES-CD ranged from moderate to good. The intraobserver agreement rates for eMS, UCEIS, CDEIS, and SES-CD ranged from good to very good. Solutions to improve interobserver agreement could allow for more accurate patient assessment, leading to richer, more accurate clinical management and clinical trial data.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOperating Properties of Disease Activity Indices in Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review.\r\nThe operating properties of pIBD clinical trial end points varied widely. These results highlight the need for further validation and development of novel indices.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Letter to the Editor regarding the article Minimally invasive surgery for Inflammatory Bowel Disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of robotic versus laparoscopic surgical techniques.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Cognition after a 4-week high phenylalanine intake in adults with phenylketonuria - a randomized controlled trial.\r\nIn early-treated adult patients with PKU, a 4-week high Phe intake was noninferior to continuing Phe restriction regarding working memory accuracy, and secondary outcomes did not differ except for sustained attention. Longer-term RCTs are required to determine whether low Phe levels need to be maintained throughout different periods of adulthood.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFish oil supplementation during pregnancy, anthropometrics, and metabolic health at age ten: A randomized clinical trial.\r\nIn this randomized clinical trial, children of mothers receiving n-3 LCPUFA supplementation had increased BMI at age 10 y, increased risk of being overweight, and a tendency of increased fat percentage and higher metabolic syndrome score. These findings suggest potential adverse health effects from n-3 LCPUFA supplementation during pregnancy and need to be replicated in future independent studies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut metabolome and microbiota signatures predict response to treatment with exclusive enteral nutrition in a prospective study in children with active Crohn's disease.\r\nWe identify microbial signals and diet-related metabolites in feces, which could comprise targets for pretreatment optimization and personalized nutritional therapy in pediatric CD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nParenteral n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids supplementation improves postoperative recovery for patients with Crohn's disease after bowel resection: a randomized, unblinded controlled clinical trial.\r\nParenteral n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids supplementation promotes postoperative recovery in patients with Crohn's disease following bowel resection, with fewer complications and reduced inflammatory cytokines.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Increased Risk of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Among Patients With Nontyphoidal Salmonella Infections: A Population-Based Cohort Study.\r\nPatients with NTS were associated with an increased risk of developing IBD, especially ulcerative colitis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNaringin Alleviates Intestinal Fibrosis by Inhibiting ER Stress-Induced PAR2 Activation.\r\nMoreover, F2rl1 (the coding gene of PAR2) deletion in intestinal epithelial cells decreases the antifibrotic effect of NAR. Hence, the ER stress-mast cell tryptase-PAR2 axis can promote intestinal fibrosis, and NAR administration can alleviate intestinal fibrosis by inhibiting ER stress-induced PAR2 activation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPrior Appendectomy Is Associated With a Milder Clinical Course in Crohn's Disease: A Nationwide Population-based Cohort Study.\r\n The clinical course of CD is milder for those who have previously undergone appendectomy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRediversion of the Failing Ileoanal Pouch: First Step in Pouch Salvage?\r\n Rediversion of ileoanal pouches is a safe initial strategy to manage failing pouches and is a useful first step in pouch salvage in many patients. Subsequent salvage surgery for noninflammatory indications had a significantly higher pouch salvage rate than those rediverted for inflammatory complications.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Norepinephrine-QseC Axis Aggravates F. nucleatum-associated Colitis Through Interkingdom Signaling.\r\nGenerally, the NE-QseC axis enhanced the pathogenicity of F. nucleatum through interkingdom signaling to aggravate colonic inflammation in IBD mice. We see that QseC may be a potential target for microbiota management of IBD under chronic pressure.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Time to Inflammatory Bowel Disease Diagnosis for Patients Presenting with Abdominal Symptoms in Primary Care and its Association with Emergency Hospital Admissions and Surgery: A Retrospective Cohort Study.\r\n Longer times to IBD diagnoses were associated with being female, advanced age, obesity, smoking, and Crohn's disease. More IBD-related emergency admissions were observed in patients with a prolonged time to diagnosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Fecal Microbiota Transplantation engraftment after budesonide or placebo in patients with active ulcerative colitis using pre-selected donors: a randomized pilot study.\r\n In this small study, pretreatment with budesonide did not significantly influence engraftment or clinical response after FMT. However, clinical response appeared donor-dependent. Response to FMT may be related to transfer of specific strains instead of overall engraftment, demonstrating the need to characterize mechanisms of actions of strains that maximize therapeutic benefit in ulcerative colitis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMagnetic resonance enterography and intestinal ultrasound for the assessment and monitoring of Crohn's disease.\r\nWe also highlight exciting new developments including the applications of artificial intelligence. Finally, we provide suggestions for future research priorities.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPredictors of symptom trajectory in newly diagnosed ulcerative colitis: a 3-year follow-up cohort study.\r\nBaseline psychological distress is predictive of increased GI symptom severity and reduced mental HRQoL over time, suggesting early assessment of psychological symptoms may identify patients who may have worse disease trajectories. Abdominal pain predicted increased psychological distress, but not the other way around. Intervening on abdominal pain may help prevent or reduce future psychological distress.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    Bariatric surgery post-Liver Transplantation: A Belgian nationwide study.\r\nSG is the favored BS post-LT and has proven to be safe and feasible in a post-LT setting with favorable metabolic consequences. SG post-LT is a valid treatment for de novo and recurrent MASLD post-LT. Although we report on the largest cohort to date, there is still a need for larger cohorts to examine the effect of BS on patient and graft survival.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRecipient hepatectomy technique may affect oncological outcomes of Liver Transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma.\r\nTCR recipient hepatectomy, compared to CS approach, may be associated with some protective effect against post-LT tumor recurrence.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    A real-world analysis of second-line treatment option, Gemcitabine plus Anlotinib and anti-PD1, in advanced pancreatic cancer.\r\n Our data confirms the effectiveness of Gemcitabine plus Anlotinib and anti-PD1 as a well-tolerated regimen in the second-line treatment of APC and extends available data on its use as a second-line treatment option when compared with FOLFIRINOX.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImpact of previous S-1 treatment on efficacy of liposomal irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.\r\nThe efficacy of second-line nal-IRI +5-FU/LV treatment was unaffected by prior S-1 exposure.
