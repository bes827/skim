Mortality rates were higher amongst the elderly and White adults. Females with CD and males with UC had higher mortality rates.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Differences in the Adverse Event Burden of Corticosteroid Use in Inflammatory Bowel Disease as Reported Between Adverse Event Reporting Systems and a Patient Questionnaire.\r\nAEs associated with IBD-related corticosteroid use were frequent. Patients reported AEs affecting quality of life, while clinicians disproportionately reported AEs based on objective diagnostic criteria.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIL23R-specific CAR Tregs for the treatment of Crohn's disease.\r\nOverall, our results demonstrate that IL23R-CAR Tregs represent a promising therapy for active CD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNovel Microbial Engraftment Trajectories following Microbiota Transplantation Therapy in Ulcerative Colitis.\r\n SourceTracker can be used as a simple and reliable method to quantify donor microbial community engraftment and donor taxa contribution in patients with ulcerative colitis and other inflammatory conditions treated with microbiota transplant therapy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPrevalence, characteristics, management, and outcomes of difficult-to-treat inflammatory bowel disease. \r\nCertain IBD phenotypes and the delay in initiating treatment in CD were risk factors for DTT. Drug persistency decreased progressively with every subsequent line of therapy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    Long-term maternal outcomes of pregnancy after orthotopic liver transplantation in the Netherlands - a retrospective multicenter cohort study.\r\nHowever, while pregnancy does not seem to impact survival after OLT, we do show that a substantial number of children will lose their mother early in life. We believe this is important for pregnancy counseling of OLT patients and their partners.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreas\r\n    Characterization of Human Pancreatic Islet Cells using a Single-Cell Western Blot Platform.\r\nThese results demonstrate that each alpha, beta, and delta cells express varying levels of peptide hormones, and a small subpopulation co-expresses double hormones in normal human islets. The scWestern platform will enable timely assessment of beta cell mass in isolated islets before clinical transplantation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCost-effectiveness of operative intervention for mucinous cystic neoplasm: the role of post-operative diabetes.\r\nSurveillance for small suspected MCNs without high-risk features is the preferred strategy from a clinical and economic standpoint. Consensus guidelines should consider the long-term implications of postoperative diabetes development following LDP.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIncreased PRIM2 expression associated with poor-prognosis in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.\r\nHigh expression of PRIM2 associated with poor prognosis in PDAC patients, PRIM2 could be used as an independent risk indicator.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIndividualized Pain Treatment in Chronic Pancreatitis (INPAIN): An International, Multicenter, Investigator-initiated, Prospective, Cohort Study.\r\n The INPAIN study aims to comprehensively understand pain in CP through a test panel developed for routine clinical use.

The most bothersome symptoms were pain, fatigue and upset stomach. Children with pancreatitis and families would like future research to primarily focus on prevention of pancreatitis attacks, pain therapy, and complications of pancreatitis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRisk factors and a prediction model for pain recurrence after pancreatic stent removal in painful chronic pancreatitis.\r\nWe identified the risk factors and developed a new prediction model for pain recurrence following stent removal. This model might be useful for decision-making in pancreatic stent management, such as deciding whether to remove a pancreatic stent, continue EPS, or convert to surgery.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    Performance of explainable artificial intelligence in guiding the management of patients with a pancreatic cyst.\r\nEBM models had greater sensitivity and specificity for identifying the correct management compared with either clinical management or previous AI models. The model predictions are demonstrated to be interpretable by clinicians.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPrognostic significance of involvement of the circumferential resection margin/surface in patients with pancreatic head cancer: A prospective evaluation of pancreatoduodenectomy specimens using the 0 and 1mmrules.\r\nThe results suggest that CRM involvement defined by the 0 mm rule is more appropriate than the 1 mm rule for predicting survival outcomes, but CS involvement defined by the 0 or 1 mm rules is not prognostically significant.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReduction of butyrate-producing bacteria in the gut microbiome of Japanese patients with pancreatic cancer.\r\nThe gut and oral microbiome differed between patients with pancreatic cancer and healthy controls, with a notable decrease in butyrate-producing bacteria in the gut microbiome of the patients. This suggests that there may be a distinct microbial signature associated with pancreatic cancer in the Japanese population. Further studies are required to elucidate the microbiome's causal role in this cancer and help develop prognostic markers or targeted therapies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Inflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Refining the Understanding of Cannabis Impact on Inflammatory Bowel Disease Outcomes: Recommendations for Enhanced Research and Healthcare Practices.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous\r\nmisc publications eg case reports, tools of the trade, images of\r\nthe month, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Inflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Risk of Paradoxical Rheumatoid Arthritis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients Exposed to Tumor Necrosis Factor Inhibitors: A Propensity-Matched Multicenter Study.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    Bulevirtide improves liver function in liver transplant candidates with advanced HDV cirrhosis and severe portal hypertension.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCON: Patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure should not be offered MELD exception points.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLeter to the editor: time for validating GEMA-Na in the united states for liver transplant waiting list prioritization.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreas\r\n    Mortality trends for acute pancreatitis during the COVID-19 pandemic in the US.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTumor immune microenvironment promotes cachexia in pancreatic cancer.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetters&Replies\r\nLetters to the editors and authors’ replies\r\n\r\n\r\n    Pancreas\r\n    From the Rare to the Extraordinary: Pancreatic Serous Cystadenocarcinoma With Hepatic and Bone Dissemination: A Letter to the Editor.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Any form of lifestyle weight loss interventions including diet, exercise, or a combination of both, can have beneficial impacts on participants with prediabetes. Protocol registration PROSPERO (CRD42023465322).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTotal energy expenditure measured using doubly labeled water in adults with major chronic diseases: A systematic review.\r\n Energy requirements vary across chronic diseases, although there is insufficient evidence to suggest that TEE is different than controls. Further research is needed to inform energy requirement recommendations that consider chronic disease.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Meta-analysis of the Therapeutic Impact of Cannabinoids in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\nThis meta-analysis of clinical trials suggests that cannabinoids are associated with improved quality of life in both CD and UC, as well as improved disease activity but not inflammation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSystematic Review: Practices and Programs in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Transition Care.\r\nTransition- and medical-related outcomes for adolescents with IBD have been shown to benefit from structured transition programs but practices vary greatly between centers. There is no current standardized transition model for patients with IBD prompting further research to guide future development of guidelines and models of care.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Advancing nutrition knowledge, skills, and attitudes in medical education and training: key themes and recommendations from the 2023 Summit. \r\nHowever, a deficiency in nutrition education persists in medical education, rendering physicians ill-prepared to address the vital role of nutrition in health and disease. This article summarizes the key themes and recommendations generated during the Summit on Medical Education in Nutrition, hosted in March 2023 by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education in collaboration with American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine and Association of American Medical Colleges.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAssociations between dietary one-carbon metabolism nutrients, genetic risk, with Alzheimer's disease: a prospective cohort study.\r\nIn this prospective cohort study, we found that higher intake of OCM nutrients is associated with a reduced risk of AD. Participants with a high genetic risk of AD are more likely to benefit from dietary OCM nutrients intake.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClinical and biochemical responses to treatment of uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition: a multicenter observational cohort from the OptiDiag study. \r\nChildren with combined deficits had higher rates of iron deficiency and wasting while those with low WHZ alone and combined deficits had higher rates of tachypnea and pneumonia during treatment. Given the comparable treatment responses of children with low WHZ alone and those with low MUAC alone, and the greater vulnerability at admission and during treatment in those with combined deficits, our findings support retaining WHZ as an independent diagnostic and admission criterion of SAM, alongside MUAC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEffect of spirulina on risk of hospitalization among patients with COVID-19: the TOGETHER randomized trial. \r\nSpirulina has no any clinical benefits as an outpatient therapy for COVID-19 compared with placebo with respect to reducing the retention in an emergency setting or COVID-19-related hospitalization. There are no differences between spirulina and placebo for other secondary outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFlavonoid intakes, COPD, adult asthma, and lung function: a cohort study in the UK Biobank.\r\nModerate to high flavonoid intakes were associated with a lower risk of COPD and better lung function, particularly among ever smokers. Promoting intakes of healthy flavonoid-rich foods, namely tea, apples and berries, may improve respiratory health and lower COPD risk, particularly in individuals with a history of smoking.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFood Processing According to the NOVA Classification is Not Associated with Glycemic Index and Glycemic Load: Results from an Analysis of 1,995 Food Items.\r\n Across analyzed foods, GI and GL did not differ between processing levels, with mixed findings for grains and vegetables. Any potential adverse outcomes associated with UPF are unlikely to be related to effects on glycemia.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLeucine requirement determined in healthy young adult males using the indicator amino acid oxidation method.\r\n The leucine requirement of young adult males is approximately 34 mg⋅kg -1 ⋅d -1 which aligns with previously published tracer balance experiments. Clinical trials registry # NCT05394155, Data described in the manuscript, code book, and analytic code will be made available upon request pending application and approval, and payment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPerspective on the health value of carbohydrate-rich foods: glycemic index and load; fiber and whole grains. \r\nFurthermore, the term \"whole grains\" that refers to \"whole grain flour\" limits the exploration of \"intact\" grains that are low GI and have useful physiological effects. We conclude that al these determinants of the health values of carbohydrate-rich foods should be used in combination to assess the health value of carbohydrate-rich foods.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Anabolic Response to a Ground Beef Patty and Soy-Based Meat Alternative: A Randomized Controlled Trial.\r\n Consumption of a 4 oz beef patty stimulates muscle and whole -body protein synthesis more than a 4 oz SBMA patty and similarly to 8 oz of SBMA.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe association of a low-inflammatory diet with the trajectory of multimorbidity: a large community-based longitudinal study.\r\nAdherence to a low-inflammatory diet was associated with decreased multimorbidity risk (hazard ratio [HR 60 years). A low-inflammatory diet may prolong chronic disease-free survival time.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe carbon isotope ratio of breath is elevated by short-term and long-term added sugar and animal protein intake in a controlled feeding study. \r\nThe breath CIR is a promising measure of long-term intakes of AS and AP, especially as proportional intakes. Approaches to increase specificity would benefit the further development of this biomarker.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTrends in Non-sugar Sweeteners Use among U.S. Adults by Chronic Diseases Presence, 1999 to March 2020.\r\nNSS use increased from 1999 to 2006, then decreased until March 2020 among entire U.S. adults and individuals with or without chronic diseases. Moreover, NSS use was generally higher among individuals with chronic diseases during study periods.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nWhat would happen in the United States if there were no cow milk-based preterm infant nutritional products: Historical perspective and evaluation of nutrient-related challenges.\r\nIn the long-term greater availability and support for the use of human milk-based products is needed. However, policy makers cannot assume that PCMBPs will not be critically needed and should identify strategies for their continued marketplace availability.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Communicating Information Regarding IBD Remission to Patients: Evidence From a Survey of Adult Patients in the United States.\r\nOur study confirms that patients tend to define remission in terms of resolving symptoms. We found little evidence of barriers preventing patients from discussing remission with their healthcare professionals. This suggests that educational material could be used to resolve this discrepancy in understanding.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopic Skipping, Stricturing, and Penetrating Complications in Crohn's Disease on Tandem Ileo-colonoscopy and Cross-sectional Imaging: A Retrospective Cohort Study.\r\nIleo-colonoscopy missed detection of active CD in approximately one-fifth of cases due to more proximal disease location. Stricturing disease might be missed in more than a third of cases if cross-sectional imaging is not performed.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHow Does an Integrated Pharmacist Add Value in the Management of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in the Era of Values-Based Healthcare?\r\nThese data can be used to further build a case for those seeking to add pharmacists to their team/services. Future studies should focus on evaluating the impact of an integrated IBD pharmacist on quality-of-care delivery together with the clinical and financial value added to IBD services compared to services that lack an integrated IBD pharmacist role.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInduction of Endoscopic Response, Remission, and Ulcer-Free Endoscopy With Upadacitinib Is Associated With Improved Clinical Outcomes and Quality of Life in Patients With Crohn's Disease. \r\nEarly improvement in endoscopic outcomes after UPA induction treatment was associated with long-term meaningful improvements in clinical outcomes and QoL in patients with CD. U-EXCEED induction trial (NCT03345836), U-EXCEL induction trial (NCT03345849), and U-ENDURE maintenance trial (NCT03345823).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPsychiatric Comorbidity Does Not Enhance Prescription Opioid Use in Inflammatory Bowel Disease as It Does in the General Population.\r\n The use of opioids is more common in people with IBD than in people without IBD. This does not appear to be driven by psychiatric comorbidity.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Achievement of Endoscopic Remission After Induction Reduces Hospitalization Burden in Crohn's Disease: Findings From a Pooled Post Hoc Analysis of Risankizumab and Upadacitinib Phase III Trials.\r\nWeek 12 endoscopic remission is independently associated with reducing 52-week disease-related hospitalizations. However, achieving this stringent endpoint within 12 weeks of therapy may be challenging. Endoscopic response may be a more realistic early endoscopic target in the post-induction timeframe. Additional research is needed to evaluate early achievement of alternative endoscopic endpoints in CD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDeficiency in epithelium RAD50 aggravates UC via IL-6-mediated JAK½-STAT3 signaling and promotes development of colitis-associated cancer in mice.\r\n RAD50 exerts anti-IL-6-related inflammatory effects in colitis and suppresses CAC. Increasing RAD50 level in colon tissues may be promising for treating patients with UC and CAC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDynamics of Gut Microbiota after Fecal Microbiota Transplantation in Ulcerative Colitis: Success Linked to Control of Prevotellaceae.\r\nThe success of FMT treatment of UC patients appears to be associated with specific gut microbiota families, such as control of Prevotellaceae. Monitoring the dynamics of these microbial families could potentially be used to inform treatment success early during FMT.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEicosatetraynoic Acid Regulates Pro-Fibrotic Pathways in an Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Derived Macrophage:Human Intestinal Organoid Model of Crohn's Disease.\r\nETYA inhibits pro-fibrotic effects of LPS-primed macrophages upon co-cultured HIO. This model may be used in future untargeted screens for small molecules to treat refractory CD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIntegrin αVß6 - autoantigen and driver of epithelial remodeling in colon and bile ducts in primary sclerosing cholangitis and inflammatory bowel disease.\r\n Anti- αVβ6 frequently occur in patients suffering from PSC, especially in PSC-IBD. Anti- αVß6 levels positively correlate to IBD activity in PSC-IBD, but may also occur in the absence of clinically manifest IBD in PSC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNested Randomized Controlled Trials in Large Databases: An Opportunity for Inflammatory Bowel Disease?\r\nThis review also details caveats of this study design that include the risk of selection bias and constraints related to comparisons with placebo. In conclusion, RCTsNC offers a promising opportunity IBD research given the challenges of the current IBD RCT landscape.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNovel Microbial Engraftment Trajectories following Microbiota Transplantation Therapy in Ulcerative Colitis. \r\nWe identified engrafting taxa from donors in our patients as well as quantified the proportion of donor similarity or engraftment during weeks one through eight (active treatment) and week 12, four weeks after the last dose. SourceTracker can be used as a simple and reliable method to quantify donor microbial community engraftment and donor taxa contribution in patients with ulcerative colitis and other inflammatory conditions treated with microbiota transplant therapy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPharmacological inhibition of N-Acylethanolamine acid amidase (NAAA) mitigates intestinal fibrosis through modulation of macrophage activity.\r\nOur findings provide new insights into the pathophysiological mechanism of intestinal fibrosis and identify NAAA as a promising target for the development of therapeutic treatments to alleviate CD fibrosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe GETAID: 40 years of a family story in IBD.\r\nThis approach very innovative has contributed to the advancement of knowledge in inflammatory bowel diseases by publishing more than 120 original articles in peer-reviewed journals throughout the GETAID 40-year history, most of them in top publications in gastroenterology and hepatology journals. In this paper, we will see what GETAID's contribution has been over the last four decades, review reasons for success and forthcoming challenges.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    A multicenter study of the risk of major bleeding in patients with and without cirrhosis undergoing percutaneous liver procedures.\r\nIn this cohort, major bleeding after percutaneous liver procedure occurred in <1% of patients, making it a low-risk procedure for patients with and without cirrhosis. Although not uniformly adopted, the current transfusion protocol still led to unnecessary blood product administration.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAdverse effects of graft congestion and ameliorative effects of hepatocyte growth factor after liver transplantation in rats.\r\nThus, congested areas in liver grafts may negatively impact recipients. Short-term administration of hepatocyte growth factor may improve postoperative outcomes of recipients with graft congestion and contribute to more effective use of liver grafts (approval number: MedKyo-23137, Institutional Ethics Committee/Kyoto University).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSafety of acamprosate for alcohol use disorder Post-Liver transplant: a pilot randomized controlled trial.\r\n In this pilot study, preliminary data suggests that acamprosate may be safe and feasible.
