When applied to mucosal cytokines previously linked to (N)R, IL-6 appears to drive inflammation in TNFi resistant UC patients, while OSM seems to parallel inflammation and does not cause refractoriness.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHistologic and Endoscopic Findings Are Highly Correlated in a Prospective Cohort of Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.\r\nIn a real-world setting, endoscopic inflammation predicted histologic inflammation with high accuracy. In patients with a Rutgeerts score of i0, microscopic inflammation in neo-TI biopsies did not predict more aggressive disease behavior over the next 4 years. These results have implications for the design of clinical trials, suggesting the use of endoscopic healing as an endpoint.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    Endoscopic ultrasound is useful for the risk stratification of mucinous pancreatic cystic lesions: A long-term prospective study.\r\nEUS-FNA is useful for the risk stratification of mucinous PCLs. The low incidence of adenocarcinoma over time after a negative EUS-FNA may allow for a less resource intensive surveillance strategy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFrozen section analysis of pancreatic resection margins during pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma is not affected by neoadjuvant therapy.\r\nThe histopathological changes occurring in the pancreas PNAT for PDAC do not affect the histopathological interpretation of FS analysis of PRMs, and the accuracy of FS analysis is similar in the PNAT and TN patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMisfolding PRSS1 variant p.Ala61Val in a case of suspected intrauterine pancreatitis.\r\nTaken together, the observations expand the repertoire of misfolding PRSS1 variants and highlight the need for functional analysis to identify this rare form of genetic etiology.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNo definite associations between opioid doses and severity of acute pancreatitis - Results from a multicentre international prospective study.\r\nThe association between opioid doses and AP severity was dose-dependent with cumulative opioid doses but not with daily doses. In the absence of adequate evidence and potential reverse causation bias, future studies are warranted to assess the safety of opioids in AP.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOnset of pancreatic cancer before and after acute pancreatitis: A multicenter longitudinal cohort study.\r\n Idiopathic AP and pseudocyst formation significantly elevate the risk of PC, particularly within two years. These findings underscore the need for structured follow-up and early screening in idiopathic AP cases to improve PC detection and survival outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOptimal indication of adding pancreatic juice cytology in the diagnosis of malignant intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas.\r\nAlthough PJC is generally not recommended for patients with IPMN, it is worth considering for the determination of treatment strategies in patients with abrupt changes in the caliber of the pancreatic duct with distal pancreatic atrophy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPatient-derived organoids from pancreatic cancer after pancreatectomy: Feasibility and organoid take rate in treatment-naïve periampullary tumors.\r\n In the current study, we found that PDOs could be established from resected pancreatic tumors in over half of resected periampullary tumors, and highest in PDACs. As such, generating a pancreatic cancer PDO biobank for translational research was feasible after cryopreservation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTime between pancreatic cancer diagnosis and treatment initiation and survival in the U.S. Military Health System.\r\nResults Overall, median time-to-treatment was 3 weeks and 95 % of patients received treatment within 12 weeks. Time-to-treatment >6 weeks was associated with a statistically significant lower risk of death (AHR = 0.77, 95 % CI = 0.61-0.98) compared to time-to-treatment 12 weeks) with survival.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Inflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Ozanimod and Vedolizumab as First-Line Advanced Therapies in Ulcerative Colitis.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous\r\nmisc publications eg case reports, tools of the trade, images of\r\nthe month, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nLetters&Replies\r\nLetters to the editors and authors’ replies\r\n\r\n\r\n    Inflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Letter: Ozanimod and Vedolizumab as First-Line Advanced Therapies in Ulcerative Colitis: Authors' Reply.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

These findings emphasize the need to prioritize a standardized approach to the diagnosis, follow-up, and treatment of PS, with future studies focusing on identifying patients who would benefit from PDAC surveillance programs.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Association of the EAT-Lancet diet, serial measures of serum proteome and gut microbiome, and cardiometabolic health: a prospective study of Chinese middle-aged and elderly adults.\r\nOur study presents key molecular evidence to support the role of EAT-Lancet diet adherence in promoting cardiometabolic health.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAssociations of body composition at birth and accretion from 0-5 years with kidney function and volume at the 10-year follow-up: the Ethiopian iABC birth cohort.\r\n A higher conditional FFM gain in age from 3-6 months resulted in better kidney function at the 10-year follow-up, whilst a higher conditional FFM gain in age from 4-5 years resulted a lower kidney function. Kidney volume at the 10-year follow-up was associated with higher birth FFM and higher conditional FM or FFM growth in most growth periods.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAssociations of early childhood exposure to severe acute malnutrition and recovery with cardiometabolic risk markers in later childhood: 5-year prospective matched cohort study in Ethiopia.\r\n Both rapid BAZ increase and decrease during early post-recovery from SAM were associated with greater cardiometabolic risk 5-years later. The findings indicate the need to target post-recovery interventions to optimize healthy weight recovery.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMaize consumption and circulating aflatoxin levels in Mexican middle- and older-aged adults: A cross-sectional analysis.\r\nMaize and maize tortilla intake was associated to AFB1-lys concentrations. This association appears to be driven by consumption of tortillas made from homemade masa.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nStandardized Assessment of Energy Excretion in Healthy Adults: A Novel Methodology.\r\nThis study presents a standardized and efficient methodology for accurately assessing energy excretion using dye-labeled replacement bars. The findings underscore the notable yet variable role of energy excretion in energy balance and suggest that this method could enhance the precision of future energy balance studies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe null need not be nil: Clarifying the parallel arbitrariness of difference testing and equivalence testing.\r\nWhen contrasted with the requirements of equivalence testing (where the smallest effect size of interest must be explicitly declared and justified a priori, in the form of the equivalence zone), it is therefore understandable how the misperception of greater arbitrariness could emerge. By combating the latter misperception, our comments serve to promote good practice in both difference testing and equivalence testing.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Dietary Carrageenan Amplifies the Inflammatory Profile, but not Permeability, of Intestinal Epithelial Cells from Patients With Crohn's Disease.\r\nDietary CGN caused upregulation of inflammatory markers and affected cytokine release of intestinal epithelial cells from CD patients, while permeability remained unaltered. When inflammation was already present, this pro-inflammatory effect was more pronounced, suggesting a role for dietary CGN during active CD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEscherichia coli Nissle Improves Short-Chain Fatty Acid Absorption and Barrier Function in a Mouse Model for Chronic Inflammatory Diarrhea.\r\nThese findings suggest that EcN is able to proliferate in the inflamed cecum, resulting in increased microbial SCFA production, decreased inflammation, and improved gut barrier properties. In sufficient dosage, probiotics may thus be an effective anti-inflammatory strategy in the diseased gut.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    Development of posttransplant diabetes mellitus in US recipients of liver transplant is influenced by OPTN region.\r\nThe performance of a novel risk prediction model for PTDM in LTRs has improved performance with the inclusion of the OPTN region. Vigilance is recommended to centers in high-risk regions to identify PTDM and mitigate its development.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLack of progress in cancer related outcomes after Liver Transplantation: Mitigating risk & identifying future needs to move this needle.\r\nProspective studies of immunosuppression modifications needed to minimize rejection and maximize cancer response are ongoing and will reduce the fear from oncology and transplant providers alike, allowing utilization of the most optimal therapy available to the individual. This review aims to assess current data to aid in clinical management and identify the needs to fascilitate further progress in this field.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTransforming the logistics of liver transplantation with normothermic machine perfusion: Clinical impact versus cost.\r\nIn conclusion, utilization of NMP comes with an attendant increase in cost but provides substantial clinical benefit. Transplant programs must weigh these considerations in their practice environments before initiating an NMP program.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    Significant projected savings with expansion of an emergency department observation protocol for mild acute pancreatitis.\r\nImplementation of an evidence-based, protocoled ED pathway for MAP could result in over $100 million in direct healthcare savings.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTrends and impact of endoscopic ultrasound utilization for suspected intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms.\r\nIn this series EUS over-utilization for low risk IPMN improved over time reflecting more conservative guidelines, without changing PDAC diagnosis rates. There was good agreement between cross-sectional imaging and EUS for specific PCL features.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous\r\nmisc publications eg case reports, tools of the trade, images of\r\nthe month, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Inflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Acute Severe Ulcerative Colitis and Cytomegalovirus During Pregnancy: A Case Report.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    Does the utilization of machine perfusion require a boundary for livers donated after circulatory death?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLess is more: The use of a single biodegradable stenting to treat biliary anastomotic strictures in pediatric Liver Transplantation.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPostoperative heartbreak: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy following Liver Transplantation.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetters&Replies\r\nLetters to the editors and authors’ replies\r\n\r\n\r\n    Inflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Letter: Ozanimod and Vedolizumab as First-Line Advanced Therapies in Ulcerative Colitis: Authors' Reply. \r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

There was an effect of 24-h RER and CARBOX during cold exposure that was related to greater ad libitum EI following cold. These results indicate an acute effect of cold on concurrent EI independent of changes in metabolic rate, but also a residual influence of cold on subsequent EI via fuel preference.

We review recent advances in each of the 11 areas and pose challenges for the genetics and genomics communities of IBD researchers.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEtrasimod as a Monotherapy or With Concomitant Use of Corticosteroids and/or Aminosalicylates: Results From the ELEVATE UC Clinical Program.\r\nEtrasimod monotherapy showed consistent efficacy and safety vs placebo;  no apparent benefit was observed with concomitant CS and/or 5-ASA in patients receiving etrasimod. Clinical trial registration\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGender and Sex Differences in Abdominal Pain, Fatigue, And Psychological Symptoms Among Adults with Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Network Analysis.\r\nThis study highlights that fatigue and anxiety are core symptoms among individuals with IBD and demonstrates a potential sex and/or gender difference in core symptoms. Replication of this study is needed with further consideration of inclusion of TGD patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImprovement of Transmural Inflammation With Adalimumab Versus Immunomodulator Maintenance Therapy in Pediatric Crohn's Disease: Single-Center Prospective Evaluation Using the Pediatric Inflammatory Crohn's Magnetic Resonance Enterography Index.\r\nADA therapy was associated with objective improvement in MRE findings of inflammation more frequently than IM. The low rate of MRE normalization suggests that this is not yet a realistic target with existing therapies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIntestinal Ultrasound Measures are Strongly Correlated With Small Bowel Endoscopic Lewis Score in Active Crohn's Disease.\r\nIUS measures are strongly correlated with VCE-inflammatory LS in active CD and may provide an assessment of endoscopic response and remission over time.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLow Surgery Rates in Early Crohn's Disease: Results from a Prospective Population-Based Inception Cohort-The Inflammatory Bowel Disease in South-Eastern Norway III Study.\r\n A high proportion of patients had ileal disease and inflammatory behavior at diagnosis. Still, nearly 40% started biologic therapy within the 1-year follow-up, while only 5% required intra-abdominal surgery.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNew Insights into the Pathogenesis of Intestinal Fibrosis in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: Focusing on Intestinal Smooth Muscle Cells.\r\nMoreover, the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways that regulate SMC hyperplasia/hypertrophy will be extensively reviewed. The understanding of the cellular network and the molecular background behind stricture formation is essential for the design of effective anti-fibrotic strategies, and SMCs might be a promising therapeutic target in the future.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nProvider Education and Clinical Decision Support Tool Improve Proficiency in Advanced Therapies for Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\nWe have built a freely accessible web-based decision support tool platform for advanced medical therapy selection in IBD that significantly improved provider mastery in decision-making for advanced medical therapies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Clinical outcomes after first-line anti-TNF treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease - a prospective multicenter cohort study.\r\nClinical response was achieved in two in three UC and three in four CD patients, meanwhile, one-third of UC and one-fourth of CD patients experienced LOR despite the short disease duration in this study. Several clinical features were associated with outcomes and may be useful predictors of anti-TNF treatment response.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDisruption of epithelial barrier integrity via altered GILZ/c-Rel/RACK1 signaling in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).\r\nWe provide the first evidence that an alteration of RACK1/SRC/E-cadherin regulatory mechanism, correlating with decreased GILZ protein expression is involved in epithelial barrier disruption. The clinical relevance is based on the fact that this mechanism involving GILZ/cRel-related RACK1 expression could be considered to improve IBD therapies, particularly in patients with low or no response to glucocorticoid treatment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMultiple Ileal and Colonic Stenoses: Is It Always Crohn's Disease?\r\nThis case highlights the importance of considering metastatic disease in the differential diagnosis of gastrointestinal (GI) strictures, particularly when inflammatory bowel disease markers are inconclusive or marginal. Clinicians should be aware of the potential for breast cancer to metastasize to the GI tract, which may present with symptoms mimicking primary GI diseases.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOpen label vancomycin in primary sclerosing cholangitis-inflammatory bowel disease: improved colonic disease activity and associations with changes in host-microbiome-metabolomic signatures.\r\n Four weeks of OV induces remission in PSC-IBD activity, associated with a reduction in gut bacterial diversity and compositional changes relating to BA and SCFA homeostasis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    Hepatitis C-positive grafts for hepatitis C-negative recipients in liver transplantation: Buried treasure or depleting resource?\r\nFurthermore, Ishak stage 2 or 3 fibrotic DBD grafts had similar 5-year GS to non-fibrotic grafts. The findings suggest that the long-term outcome of using HCV-viremic DBD or DCD grafts for HCV-negative recipients is comparable to that of other graft types, and that fibrotic grafts have the potential to expand the DBD donor pool.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImmune checkpoint inhibitors in the post-transplant landscape of hepatocellular carcinoma: A systematic literature review.\r\nICIs show potential for treating recurrent HCC after liver transplantation, but the risk of graft rejection is significant. Careful patient selection, close monitoring, and individualized management of immunosuppression are crucial. Positive PD-L1 expression and the choice of immunosuppressive regimen appear to influence the risk of graft rejection;  however, these findings are based on limited data. Prospective studies with larger sample sizes are needed to validate these findings and establish evidence-based guidelines for the use of ICIs in the post-transplant setting.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMaterial economic hardship is associated with adverse 1-year outcomes after pediatric liver transplantation: Prospective cohort results from the multi-center SOCIAL-Tx study.\r\nOur findings highlight the adverse influence of household material economic hardship on pediatric liver transplant outcomes within the first year. Targeted social risk assistance and adjustment strategies offer actionable avenues to mitigate these challenges and enhance outcomes in pediatric liver transplant recipients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSurvival outcomes following liver retransplantation (reSOFT) score: A model predicting survival after adult liver retransplantation.\r\nThe reSOFT score was developed by assigning points to these factors proportional to their hazard ratios and divided into high-, moderate-, and low-risk groups that accurately predict 3-month survival post-retransplant. With a C-statistic of 0.73 (CI 0.71-0.75), this tool may serve to guide clinicians in identifying and better caring for high-risk re-transplant recipients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    Impact of islet autotransplantation on 30-day post-operative outcomes in patients undergoing total pancreatectomy: A NSQIP retrospective cohort analysis of 584 patients.\r\n The results from this study suggest that TPIAT does not appear to be associated with increased 30-day morbidity, and should be considered in patients to mitigate the long-term morbidity associated with diabetes mellitus post TP.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMethionine restriction inhibits pancreatic cancer proliferation while suppressing JAK2/STAT3 pathway.\r\n MR suppressed the JAK2/STAT3 pathway and decreased NF-kB in some PC cell lines.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatic extracellular volume fraction on routine contrast-enhanced computed tomography can predict pancreatic fibrosis and postoperative pancreatic fistula.\r\nPancreatic ECV obtained from routine CE-CT images accurately predicted the histopathological grade of pancreatic fibrosis and was an independent risk factor for POPF after PD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThree-tiered critical care management of acute pancreatitis.\r\n Our findings suggest that on-admission CRP and amylase cannot reliably predict progression of AP. However, elevated and increasing levels of CRP and amylase may indicate the need for early HDU admission to enable closer monitoring.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous\r\nmisc publications eg case reports, tools of the trade, images of\r\nthe month, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    A broader perspective on nutrition research: the rationale for integrating the entire continuum of human nutrition.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Advancing Toward Transmural Healing in Pediatric Crohn's Disease.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    Caveat of biliary ph as biomarker of bile duct viability during normothermic machine perfusion of donor livers.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInequity in access to liver transplant care: Time to make the invisible visible.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLetter to the Editor: Normothermic regional perfusion in controlled DCD liver procurement- Comparable outcomes to DBD liver transplantation in three different European countries.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLetter to the Editor: Normothermic regional perfusion in controlled DCD liver procurement: Comparable outcomes to DBD liver transplantation in three different European countries.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe impact of normothermic machine perfusion on coagulation function and transfusion practice: Miracle Machine or anticipatory bias.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreas\r\n    Pancreatitis during COVID-19 pandemic in US. some comments.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetters&Replies\r\nLetters to the editors and authors’ replies\r\n\r\n\r\n    Pancreatology\r\n    Autoimmune pancreatitis associated with severe postoperative pneumonia.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
