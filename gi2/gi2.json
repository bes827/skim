Bifidobacteria metabolize lactose without gas production thereby potentially reducing intestinal gas formation in the gut of individuals with the LNP-genotype. This increased lactose tolerance possibly lifts the necessity to remove nutrient-rich dairy foods completely from the diet. Registration number of clinical trial The trial is registered at the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform  NL9516 The effect of dietary lactose in lactase non-persistent individuals on gut microbiota.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClimate-based variability in the essential fatty acid composition of soybean oil. \r\nFrom this work, it was determined that soybean oil manufactured from soybeans in the southern United States may contain insufficient ALA to meet human nutritional needs because of high-daytime temperatures. This work suggests that climate-based variation may result in many human populations not achieving an adequate daily intake of ALA.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEstimation of 24-hour urinary sodium and potassium excretion among Chinese adults: a cross-sectional study from the China National Nutrition Survey. \r\nThe first nationwide survey with 24-h urine collection confirmed that mean sodium intake in Chinese adults was more than twice the upper limit, whereas mean potassium intake was <60% of the lower limit, recommended by the World Health Organization. Urgent measures should be taken to reduce sodium intake and increase potassium intake in China.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFood Insecurity, Neighborhood Food Environment, and Health Disparities: State of the Science, Research Gaps and Opportunities.\r\nThe workshop had three research objectives: 1) summarize the state of the science and knowledge gaps related to food insecurity, neighborhood food environments, and nutrition health disparities, 2) identify research opportunities and strategies to address research gaps, and 3) examine evidence-based interventions and implementation approaches to address food insecurity and neighborhood food environments to promote health equity.
