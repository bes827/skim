Standardizing tapering protocols and defining CSF-CR are essential for accurate outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTOpClass Class 4 Perineal Crohn's Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Perineal Wound Complication After Proctectomy in Crohn's Patients.\r\nThis meta-analysis revealed complete perineal healing in only 70% of patients 12 months after proctectomy for CD. This highlights knowledge gaps, including the identification of modifiable risk factors and methods for preventing or as rescue therapy, such as vacuum-assisted closure and flap reconstruction, for nonhealing perineal wounds after proctectomy for CD. Poor perineal wound healing outcomes are likely related to imperfectly understood underlying inflammatory dysregulation and systemically impaired wound healing in patients with CD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Intermittent versus Continuous Calorie Restriction for Treatment of Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease: A Randomized Clinical Trial.\r\nThe ICR and CCR schemes had similar effects on reducing liver fat content, suggesting that the ICR 5 2 diet can be an effective alternative for treating MASLD with high adherence.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSARC-Calf using calf circumference adjusted for BMI predicts six-months readmission and mortality in hospitalized patients: a secondary analysis of a cohort study.\r\nSARC-Calf with BMI-adjusted CC identified a high frequency of patients with suggestive signs of sarcopenia, regardless of age, and it was independently associated with worse outcomes six months after discharge. Statement of significance Suggestive signs of sarcopenia cannot be accurately identified by SARC-Calf in individuals with high BMI due to the influence of adiposity on calf circumference (CC) measurements. In this secondary analysis, we explored the prognostic value of SARC-Calf with BMI-adjusted CC, aiming to correct the influence of adiposity on the CC measurement. We confirmed that this approach identifies a high number of patients with suggestive signs of sarcopenia and showed that it was independently related to worse outcomes six months after hospital discharge in both adults and older patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Circulating Extracellular Matrix Products as Indicators of Disease Burden and Predictors of Disease Course in Ulcerative Colitis.\r\nSoluble ECM fragments reflect endoscopic disease severity and extent and are also predictive of therapeutic efficacy. They may as well reflect degenerative aspects of UC and may as such be future therapeutic targets aimed at prevention of intestinal damage.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGLP-1 Receptor Agonists Confer No Increased Rates of IBD Exacerbation Among Patients With IBD.\r\nIn patients with IBD, GLP-1 receptor agonists are effective for weight loss and associated with few episodes of disease exacerbation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut Microbial Signatures in Pediatric Crohn's Disease Vary According to Disease Activity Measures and Are Influenced by Proxies of Gastrointestinal Transit Time: An ImageKids Study.\r\nIn CD, microbiome signatures fluctuate depending on the measure used to assess disease severity;  several of these signals might be secondary disease effects linked with changes in gut motility in active disease. PICMI appears to be less influenced when studying relationships between microbiome and mural inflammation in CD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLow Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Levels During Maintenance Phase Are Associated With Treatment Failure in Children With Crohn's Disease.\r\nLD-MTX combination was not associated with higher drug levels, but higher drug levels were associated with reduced risk of treatment failure. Among patients with therapeutic drug levels, we observed no benefit of LD-MTX for patients treated with infliximab. A nonsignificant trend towards reduced treatment failure with the addition of LD-MTX patients treated with adalimumab warrants further investigation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMacrophage-Derived Exosomes Promoted the Development and Stemness of Inflammatory Bowel Disease-Related Colorectal Cancer via nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1-Mediated miRNA-34a-5p/phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes 15 Axis.\r\nThese findings provide novel insights into how macrophages affect CRC development and highlight exosomal NEAT1 as a therapeutic target for CRC treatment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMicrobial and Transcriptomic Landscape Associated With Neutrophil Extracellular Traps in Perianal Fistulizing Crohn's Disease.\r\nOur findings reveal unique microbial and transcriptomic signatures associated with NETs in pfCD, highlighting their profound influence on clinical outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPredicting Outcomes in Hospitalized Patients With Acute Severe Ulcerative Colitis in a Prospective Multicenter Cohort.\r\nIn a prospective, multicenter cohort of patients hospitalized with ASUC, BMI, SCCAI, and albumin at admission were important determinants of colectomy risk during the index hospitalization and within 1 year of admission. Colectomy rates remain high-22.3% in this cohort across 5 academic, tertiary care centers-underscoring the need to identify the highest-risk patients, establish novel treatment and care paradigms, and examine opportunities to standardize care.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Effect of Colesevelam on the Microbiome in Postoperative Crohn's Disease.\r\nThis small pilot study demonstrated that patients who were given colesevelam, were more likely to be in disease remission at their 6-12 months colonoscopy review compared with those not treated. Furthermore, treatment with colesevelam may have a role in altering the microbiome to help maintain remission states in postoperative Crohn's disease. Larger mechanistic studies are now needed to confirm these findings and demonstrate statistical significance as well as investigate whether this benefit may be present even in those patients with 75SeHCAT negative disease.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThree-Year Efficacy and Safety of Mirikizumab Following 152 Weeks of Continuous Treatment for Ulcerative Colitis: Results From the LUCENT-3 Open-Label Extension Study.\r\nSymptomatic, clinical, endoscopic, histologic, and quality-of-life outcomes support long-term sustained benefit of mirikizumab treatment up to 152 weeks in patients with UC, including biologic-failed patients, with no new safety concerns. Clinical trial registry ClinicalTrials.gov  NCT03518086;  NCT03524092;  NCT03519945.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    GLP-1 analog use is associated with improved disease course in inflammatory bowel disease: a report from the Epi-IIRN.\r\n GLP-1 analogs are associated with improved outcomes in IBD, specifically in patients with obesity. The mechanisms of these effects require further investigation as well as their role in patients without DM2.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPost-Discharge Outcomes of Elderly Patients Hospitalized for Inflammatory Bowel Disease Flare Complicated by Clostridioides difficile Infection.\r\nIn elderly IBD patients hospitalized for IBD flare and subsequently discharged, a concurrent CDI infection was not associated with post-discharge IBD-related complications or mortality up to 1-year.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Bidirectional Effects of Periodontal Disease and Oral Dysbiosis on Gut Inflammation in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\n Our study suggests that patients with aIBD have severer periodontal disorders and higher relative abundances of putative \"pro-inflammatory\" microbiota in their oral cavity, despite normal oral hygiene behaviors. Our data are consistent with the potential presence of an oral-gut inflammatory-axis that could trigger IBD flare-ups in at-risk patients. Routine dental health assessments in al IBD patients should be encouraged as part of the health maintenance of IBD and as a potential strategy to decrease the risk of IBD flares.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    Comparative outcomes of Living Donor Liver Transplantation in elderly recipients: A study on morbidity and survival in 1,018 recipients.\r\n This study suggests that carefully selected elderly patients can undergo LDLT and achieve comparable short-term outcomes to their younger counterparts.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe learning curve for robotic living donor right hepatectomy: Analysis of outcomes in two specialized centers.\r\nComplication rates were lower after the learning curves were achieved, although this did not reach statistical significance. A comparison of outcomes between centers suggests that a standardized approach to this complex operation can be successfully transferred.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    A causal relationship between distinct immune features and acute or chronic pancreatitis: results from a mendelian randomization analysis.\r\nOur MR study identified immune traits causally linked to acute and chronic pancreatitis, offering new insights for early clinical intervention and immune cell-targeted therapies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAlterations in the gut microbiota in patients with long-term follow-up after pancreaticoduodenectomy and their association with postoperative fatty liver: A pilot study.\r\nThe gut microbiota of patients after PD was in dysbiosis at postoperative ≥6 months. Development of fatty liver might be associated with significant differences in gut microbiota.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClinical significance and therapeutic implication of CD200 in pancreatic cancer.\r\nOur data underscore novel roles for CD200 in immune evasion as well as therapy resistance in pancreatic cancer. CD200 may represent a novel poor prognostic predictive factor and potential therapeutic target for PDAC with NACRT.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPrescribing of pancreatic enzyme therapy for malabsorption in unresectable pancreatic cancer: Cross-sectional survey across New Zealand and Australia.\r\n This study suggests clinicians are over-reliant on faecal elastase to diagnose PEI and are uncertain about the correct dose and timing of PERT for optimal patient benefit in those with unresectable pancreatic cancer. Most clinicians were not aware of best practice guidelines.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Inflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    DNA-Thioguanine (DNA-TG) Is a Promising Novel Method to Predict Adverse Events to Thiopurine in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial Response to the Letter Relating to our Article \"Predicting Adverse Events to Thiopurines in IBD: Are We a Step Closer?\"\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRisankizumab Is Effective for the Management of Crohn's Disease of the Pouch.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    IL-23R-Specific Chimeric Antigen Receptor Tregs in Crohn's Disease: Dawn of a Cellular Immunotherapeutic Era?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMultiomics Resolves Regulatory Mechanisms in a Diverse Cohort of Crohn's Disease.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous\r\nmisc publications eg case reports, tools of the trade, images of\r\nthe month, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Inflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    The Pouch Corner: Perianal Fistulas and Ileal Pouches: Examining Fistulas Before and After Pouch Creation.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    Are the differences really different? understanding the role of induction immunosuppression on pediatric liver transplant outcomes.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCystatin C in decompensated cirrhosis: Shedding the excess baggage in clinical practice.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLetter to the editor: Improved outcomes of ABO incompatible living donor liver transplant with biologically related donors.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReply: Improved outcomes of ABO incompatible living donor liver transplant with biologically related donor.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetters&Replies\r\nLetters to the editors and authors’ replies\r\n\r\n\r\n    Pancreatology\r\n    Response to \"Evaluation of postoperative pancreatic fistula prediction scales following pancreatoduodenectomies based on magnetic resonance imaging: A diagnostic test study\".\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

We propose a tool for reporting immunosuppression protocols which could be implemented in future transplant oncology studies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    Impact of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy on pathologic response in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: A systematic review and meta-analysis.\r\nChemoradiotherapy may have a positive impact on pathologic response and R0 resection rate, whereas a survival benefit was not reported.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    A Flavonoid-Rich Diet is Associated with Lower Risk and Improved Imaging Biomarkers of NAFLD: A Prospective Cohort Study.\r\n The consumption of flavonoid-rich foods was associated with a reduced risk of NAFLD among middle-aged adults.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAre the EAT-Lancet dietary recommendations associated with cardiometabolic health? - insights from the Generation XXI cohort from childhood into early adolescence.\r\nThe adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet from an early age may help reduce cardiometabolic risk in early adolescence.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFolate and cobalamin status, indicators, modulators, interactions and reference ranges from early pregnancy until birth: The Reus-Tarragona Birth Cohort Study.\r\nSuboptimal early pregnancy folate or cobalamin status affected47.4% and 7.3% of the participants, respectively. The MTHFR 677TT genotype consistently predicted folate status throughout pregnancy. Smoking and BMI were negatively associated with cobalamin status throughout pregnancy. Clinical trial registry number and website where it was obtained NCT01778205. .\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLongitudinal Study of Seafood and Fish Oil Supplement Intake and Risk of Persistent Tinnitus.\r\n Regular consumption of tuna fish, light-meat fish or shellfish is associated with lower risk of developing persistent tinnitus in females. Fish oil supplement use is associated with higher risk.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    A Review of Cutaneous Extraintestinal Manifestations of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Skin of Color.\r\nThis review aims to describe the cutaneous manifestations of IBD in a wide range of skin tones with several examples to improve awareness. With further awareness, this review will enable to provide equitable care to IBD patients with cutaneous EIMs.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIleoanal Pouch-Related Fistulas: A Narrative Review.\r\nFistulas associated with anastomotic complications, technical surgical issues, and cryptoglandular fistulas warrant surgical management. On the other hand, fistulas associated with inflammation are preferentially managed with biologics or small molecules.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTargeting NCAPD2 as a Therapeutic Strategy for Crohn's Disease: Implications for Autophagy and Inflammation.\r\nOur results show that NCAPD2 suppresses autophagy and worsens intestinal inflammation by modulating mTOR signaling and impacting the NF-κB pathway, suggesting a critical role in CD progression. Targeting NCAPD2 could be a promising therapeutic approach to stop CD advancement.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis share two molecular subtypes with different mechanisms and drug response.\r\nThis study discovered and validated a robust transcriptome-based molecular classification shared by CD and UC and built a 20-gene classifier. Because two subtypes have different molecular mechanisms and drug response, our classification may aid interpretation of heterogeneous molecular and clinical information in IBD patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe circulating methylome in childhood-onset inflammatory bowel disease.\r\nPassive smoking exposure is associated with the development of UC rather than CD contrary to previous findings. These data provide new insights into epigenetic alterations in IBD and illustrate the reproducibility and translational potential of epigenome-wide association studies in complex diseases.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe intestinal mucin isoform landscape reveals region-specific biomarker panels for inflammatory bowel disease patient stratification.\r\n We unveiled region-specific mucin RNA isoform panels capturing the heterogeneity of the IBD patient population and showing great potential to indicate barrier function in IBD patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    Analysis of treatment benefits and prognostic factors for Post-Transplant hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence in a large Euro-American-Asian cohort.\r\n Curative-intent treatments should be advocated for patients with post-transplant recurrence whenever possible. Prognostic factors linked to aggressive tumor biology significantly influence survival. Advancements in HCC management have improved survival outcomes over the past five years.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLess is more: The use of a single biodegradable stenting to treat biliary anastomotic strictures in pediatric liver transplantation.\r\n The use of biodegradable stents stents could be good option for treating anastomotic biliary strictures in pediatric liver transplant patients, with our series showing a success rate of over 90% and an average follow-up of 43.9 months.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMarked variation in disease acuity and outcomes on the liver transplant waiting list by sociodemographic characteristics.\r\nIn the US, residence in areas of high socioeconomic disadvantage is significantly associated with higher MELD-NA at the time of wait listing among Hispanic White candidates. In addition, residence in areas of high socioeconomic disadvantage was associated with a higher risk of death or removal from the wait list and lower chances of receiving a liver transplant after wait list placement, particularly among Non-Hispanic White candidates and older candidates.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTakotsubo cardiomyopathy following liver transplantation - a multicenter cohort study.\r\n TCM following LT is associated with a significant reduction in LVEF, however the majority of patients recover LVEF to > 50% with minimal perioperative mortality. Importantly, follow-up assessment of LVEF has significant implications as lack of recovery is associated with worse OS.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nValue of factor v in the diagnosis of early graft dysfunction after liver transplantation. internal validation.\r\nPatients meeting both criteria had a 74-fold increased risk of graft loss, with most losses occurring within the first week, and a median survival of 4 days. These findings suggest that Factor V and ALT on postoperative day 2 are reliable early markers for predicting graft loss, enabling risk stratification and guiding critical decisions regarding early retransplantation in the immediate postoperative period.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreas\r\n    HSP70 promotes pancreatic cancer cell epithelial-mesenchymal transformation and growth via the NF-κB signaling pathway.\r\n HSP70 promotes the EMT and enhances pancreatic cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by activating the NF-κB pathway.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    Efficiency evaluation of dual-energy CT to predict the postoperative early recurrence of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.\r\nDECT quantitative parameters allow for the noninvasive prediction of postoperative ER in patients with PDAC, and the combination of DECT parameters and basic CT features shows a high prediction efficiency. Our model can help to identify patients with high-risk factors to guide preoperative decision making.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOral high-carbohydrate solution as an alternative dietary modality in patients with acute pancreatitis.\r\nIn patients with AP, OCS diet was associated with a lower rate of recurrent postprandial pain compared to a CD.
