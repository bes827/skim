Research concerning the endoscopic severity assessment of Crohn's disease is limited and should be further explored. More rigorous external validation of AI models and increased transparency of data and codes are needed to improve the quality of AI studies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    Effect of selective COX-2 inhibitors and non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on severity of acute pancreatitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis.\r\nSelective COX-2 inhibitors potentially mitigate disease severity and shorten hospitalization in patients with AP, while non-selective NSAIDs lack this benefit. Confirmatory large-scale RCTs are warranted to validate these findings.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Associations between Placental Parameters and Childhood BMI Trajectories from Birth to 9 Years of Age in the Lifeways Cross-Generation Cohort.\r\n Higher placental weight was initially associated with higher offspring BMI in a non-sex-specific manner, but its influence diminishes by age nine. The influence of maternal BMI on offspring BMI at age nine may reflect the cumulative impact of maternal BMI on offspring BMI trajectories as children approach pre-adolescence. Future research should include larger, more diverse populations to better understand these associations.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFOOD COMPASS SCORE-10: VALIDATION OF A METHOD FOR EVALUATING THE HEALTHFULNESS OF FOODS AND BEVERAGES USING INGREDIENT LIST INFORMATION.\r\nFCS-10 offers a practical approach for estimating the healthfulness of diverse packaged foods and beverages using readily available label data while maintaining the strengths of the original system.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    The Impact of Endoscopic Healing on Disease-Related Outcomes in Patients With Ulcerative Proctitis.\r\nUP patients with EH had less IBD-related healthcare utilization, fewer IBD-related complications, and were less likely to escalate therapy after relapse than patients without EH. Using a treatment target of EH may therefore be desirable in UP.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Corticosteroid-Sparing Effects of Risankizumab Efficacy and Safety in Patients With Moderately to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis.\r\n Efficacy of RZB induction therapy was independent of corticosteroid use, with high rates of corticosteroid-free outcomes observed in the overall population and among patients with baseline corticosteroid use, reaffirming the potential of RZB to serve as a corticosteroid-sparing therapy for patients with ulcerative colitis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFidaxomicin for Clostridioides difficile infection in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a multicentre retrospective cohort study.\r\nFidaxomicin was effective and safe in IBD patients with CDI, with greater effectiveness in CDI-naïve patients, potentially influencing short-term IBD outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPatient-donor similarity and donor-derived species contribute to the outcome of faecal microbiota transplantation for ulcerative colitis.\r\nThis study provides important insights for developing patient-tailored FMT-based therapies for UC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReal-world Effectiveness of Ustekinumab Versus Anti-TNF or Vedolizumab in Ulcerative Colitis: Induction and 12-Month Maintenance Results from the Prospective, Observational RUN-UC Study.\r\n In the prospective RUN-UC study with PS-weighted groups, UST showed higher treatment persistence but no significant difference in maintenance effectiveness compared to anti-TNF or VDZ in UC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe mediating role of psychological inflexibility on internalised stigma and patient outcomes in a sample of adults with inflammatory bowel disease.\r\n Psychological inflexibility significantly impacts quality of life in individuals with internalised stigma related to IBD and mediates the relationship between internalised stigma and patient outcomes. Increasing psychological flexibility in adults with IBD may reduce distress and enhance quality of life. Longitudinal studies and trials of psychological interventions targeting psychological flexibility warrant exploration.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    Center-Level variations are associated with disparate waitlist mortality and probability of liver transplant in MELD 35 and greater patients.\r\nFor patients receiving an LT, post-transplant survival did not differ among the groups, though high-risk centers transplanted far less high-acuity patients. These variations may indicate that certain centers are associated with substantially decreased waitlist mortality for the highest acuity patients without corresponding decreases in post-transplant survival.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGeospatial analysis of liver donation after death by drug intoxication.\r\n Assessing liver donation following drug intoxication allows for targeted efforts to increase donations in regions with the greatest potential for improvement.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReduction of hepatectomy times in dutch organ procurement teams.\r\n In conclusion, a significant and relevant reduction in hepatectomy time was achieved with this intervention program.
