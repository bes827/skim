Although bleeding risk may potentially be mitigated by a reduction in the duration of full dose heparinization without a corresponding risk in PVT rate, further investigation is warranted.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatic adenocarcinoma patients with pain have abnormal central pain processing.\r\nP-QST revealed abnormal central pain processing in PDAC patients compared to healthy controls, which may have implications for pain management.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSuboptimal adherence to surveillance in high-risk individuals for pancreatic cancer at a tertiary care academic center: Lessons from real-world surveillance patterns.\r\nIt is difficult to achieve high adherence rates for annual pancreatic cancer screening of HRIs as recommended by the latest guidelines. Age and screening modality may be factors that contribute to adherence difficulty.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe impact of delayed graft function after pancreas transplantation on clinical outcomes and survival.\r\nOf note, in the multivariable analysis pDGF showed a strong trend towards worse graft survival without reaching statistical significance (HR:2.33, 95 % CI: 0.95-5.82;  p = 0.069) CONCLUSION: pDGF represents a common condition, depending both from donor and recipient conditions. Its clinical impact concerns the early postoperative stay and the long-term graft survival as well.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Three Decades of the Mediterranean Diet Pyramid: A Narrative Review of Its History, Evolution, and Advances.\r\nThe development of the MedDiet pyramid 30 years ago inspired the creation of the Asian, African, and Latin American Heritage Diet Pyramids.

This work will help in the development of future predictive models to guide thromboprophylaxis in IBD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Adherence to EAT-Lancet diet, biological aging and life expectancy in the UK Biobank: a cohort study.\r\nAdherence to EAT-lancet diet is linked to delayed biological aging and increased life expectancy, regardless of genetic predisposition. This suggests that promoting this sustainable dietary pattern could serve as a practical nutritional strategy for enhancing healthy longevity.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAssessing the adherence and acceptability to iron and folic acid versus multiple micronutrient supplements during pregnancy: A cluster-randomized non-inferiority trial in Cambodia.\r\nBoth IFA and MMS were highly acceptable, yet adherence to MMS was superior to IFA. These findings support the transition from IFA to MMS in Cambodia.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImpact of Dietary Cholesterol from Eggs and Saturated Fat on LDL Cholesterol Levels: A Randomized Cross-Over Study.\r\n Saturated fat, not dietary cholesterol, elevates LDL cholesterol. Compared with consuming a high-saturated fat diet with only one egg per week, consuming two eggs daily as part of a low-saturated fat diet lowers LDL concentrations, which may reduce CVD risk. However, this effect on CVD risk may be mitigated, at least in part, by a reduction in less-atherogenic large LDL-particles and an increase in more atherogenic small LDL-particles.

Clinical Trial Registry number and website where it was obtained NCT03531658, /study/NCT03531658.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Association of Early Pregnancy Vitamin D and BMI Status with Composite Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes: an Ancillary Analysis of the Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial.\r\nWhile vitamin D supplementation did not reduce APO risk, higher early pregnancy 25(OH)D concentrations were associated with lower odds of APOs in participants with BMI <25 kg/m 2 . These findings highlight the potential importance of higher early pregnancy 25(OH)D concentrations, particularly among those with normal BMI, in reducing APO risk.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe harms of high protein intake: conjectured, postulated, claimed, and presumed, but shown?\r\nIn this perspectives article, we discuss several of the postulated harms cited in academic and lay publications and investigate the strength of evidence to support or refute these asserted harms. We highlight areas of caution relating to experimental design and interpretation of results and propose areas of research that would be helpful to better determine the potential risks associated with high dietary protein intake.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    18F-FAPI PET/CT for Early Detection and Severity Assessment of Intestinal Fibrosis in a Mouse Model.\r\nAs Crohn's disease (CD) with intestinal fibrosis progresses, 18F-FAPI uptake is high in the early stages and then gradually decreases. Activated fibroblasts appear more frequently in the early stages of intestinal fibrosis indicates that 18F-FAPI PET has a great potential for early identification of intestinal fibrosis and provides new insights into treatment decision-making in CD patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCrohn's Disease Stricture Response to Treatment Assessed with Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Intestinal Ultrasound: STRIDENT Randomized Trial.\r\nRadiologic severity of Crohn's disease strictures can improve with drug treatment, with complete stricture resolution observed in some. Intestinal ultrasound and MRI are effective modalities for monitoring the treatment response in patients with stricturing Crohn's disease (STRIDENT Drug Therapy Study  NCT03220841).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDisparities in Access and Treatment for Rural Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Survey of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients and Providers.\r\nThese results demonstrate disparities between rural and urban patients' treatments and access to specialty IBD care. Rural patients and providers are supportive of collaborating with IBD specialists and MDTs. These results can help guide the implementation of innovative IBD care models in the setting of an increasingly complex IBD landscape.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInnate and Adaptive Immunity is not Impacted by Inflammatory Bowel Disease Medications in Pregnant Women and Their Offspring.\r\nThis study provides the foundation for ongoing investigation to more definitively extricate the impact of maternal IBD activity, drug exposures, and disease phenotype on infant immune system development and function. These novel data suggest that IBD pharmacotherapies may not significantly impact maternal or infant immune regulation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMonitoring Structural Bowel Damage in Patients With Crohn's Disease Using Intestinal Ultrasonography: Can It Be Reversed by Biological Treatment?\r\nBiological treatment can reverse SBD in CD, but hospitalizations and surgery rates remain higher in this group.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    Clinical and pathological spectrum of disease severity among patients with acute liver failure (ALF) undergoing deceased donor liver transplantation.\r\n Virtually every patient undergoing liver transplantation for ALF retrospectively appeared to need their transplant, based on expert clinical consensus review. Overall, there was poor correlation between clinical severity and apparent degree of necrosis seen in the 300 liver explants, except perhaps for APAP subjects.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Inflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    AI-Assisted IBD Severity Classification: A Critical Perspective on Current Evidence and Next Steps.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMaternal Microchimerism, a Red Flag or a Red Herring in Very-Early-Onset Inflammatory Bowel Disease?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPast But Not Forgotten: Innate Factors Affect the Course of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Be precise, be reproducible!
