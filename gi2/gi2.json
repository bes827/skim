There was a paucity of contemporary evidence for arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury in HM or IF in the United States, but we identified evidence from other countries that could help inform these knowledge gaps. Public health agencies recommend feeding infants HM given the benefits outweigh potential risks of contaminant exposure.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx J Crohns Colitis\r\n    Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 Receptor Agonists (GLP1-RA) and the Clinical Outcomes of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD): A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.\r\nInterpretation Patients with IBD and obesity using GLP1-RAs were able to achieve significant weight loss and had lower risks of surgery and hospitalizations. Our findings require confirmation in prospective trials of GLP1-RAs in IBD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Effect of saffron extract supplementation on mood in healthy adults with subclinical symptoms of depression: A randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study.\r\n Saffron extract supplementation did not affect subclinical depressive symptoms, either measured as a composite score or individual symptom categories. A potential effect on improved mental health outcomes cannot be excluded but requires further replication in future well-powered trials. Saffromfood study, clinicaltrial.gov  NCT05690126.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Erythromycin plus metoclopramide combination therapy compared with erythromycin or metoclopramide monotherapy for postpyloric spiral nasoenteric tube placement: a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled superiority trial.\r\nThe combination therapy of erythromycin and metoclopramide was not superior to erythromycin or metoclopramide monotherapy in facilitating postpyloric placement of spiral NETs in critically ill patients. However, the combination therapy was associated with a higher incidence of drug side effects compared with the metoclopramide monotherapy. The trial was registered with (trial ID ChiCTR1900022508).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Lanthanum carbonate lowers serum phosphorus without altering body phosphorus burden in maintenance peritoneal dialysis patients: a randomized crossover trial.\r\nMethods Seven adult patients undergoing maintenance peritoneal dialysis underwent full metabolic balance studies for phosphorus in a research ward while they ate a constant phosphorus diet. Patients were studied during a baseline period without phosphate binders and while they received, in random order, 3 doses of lanthanum carbonate (La treatment lowered serum phosphorus concentration but did not change body phosphorus content.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Mediterranean diet, metabolic signature, genetic predisposition, and risk of rheumatoid arthritis: a large-scale population-based prospective cohort study.\r\nWe identified a robust metabolic signature reflecting the metabolic response to the MED diet. This signature was inversely associated with RA risk and partially mitigated the genetic susceptibility to RA. These findings highlight the potential of metabolic signature for enhancing dietary assessment and guiding personalized nutritional intervention.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Optimizing management of uncomplicated acute malnutrition in children in rural Niger: a 3-arm individually randomized, controlled, noninferiority trial.\r\nOnly the ComPAS protocol demonstrated noninferiority to standard treatment in ITT and PP analyses for children with MUAC <125 mm or edema. The OptiMA protocol's lower performance is unclear, but it suggests that reduced RUTF dosage had limited influence on overall child growth, as ComPAS used less RUTF than OptiMA. For the most malnourished children with MUAC <115 mm or edema, the standard protocol showed a higher recovery proportion, primarily due to better attendance rather than differences in mortality or growth at 6 mo. Further studies are needed to better understand the acceptability and population-level impact of simplified protocols in multiple settings.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Sugar restriction in the first 1000 days after conception, and long-term respiratory health: a quasi-experiment study.\r\nRestricting sugar intake during the first 1,000 d after conception was associated with reduced risk and delayed onset of asthma and COPD, and improved lung function in adulthood. These findings support the utility of current dietary guidelines to promote lifelong respiratory health.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Sustainable diets reduce diet-related greenhouse gas emissions and improve diet quality: results from the MyPlanetDiet randomized controlled trial.\r\nPersonalized sustainable dietary advice led to healthier diets and lower diet-related GHGE with no short-term negative health effects.

This indicates a disruption of the gut barrier with increasing mucosal colonization or invasion of the bacteria. The finding is independent of clinical metadata and confounders and occurs in new-onset IBD but not in non-IBD intestinal inflammation, which suggests disease specificity.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Health-Related Physical Fitness in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease vs Healthy Control Subjects.\r\nPatients with IBD have higher body fat and reduced cardiorespiratory fitness and muscular strength compared with healthy control subjects. Especially, patients with a higher age, female sex, higher body mass index, fatigue, arthritis, or multiple biologicals used are at risk for such impairments and may benefit from physical exercise interventions.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx J Crohns Colitis\r\n    Comprehensive proteomic profile in newly diagnosed patients with inflammatory bowel disease: identification of potential biomarkers.\r\n   This comprehensive proteomic study has identified a set of proteins differentially expressed in IBD, which may contribute to a better understanding of its mechanisms and hold promise as candidate biomarkers. Although these findings are preliminary, they warrant further investigation to evaluate their diagnostic and therapeutic relevance.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Disease duration impacts intestinal gene expression profiles in crohn's disease but not in ulcerative colitis.\r\n Disease duration influences intestinal gene expression in CD but significantly less in UC. The identified pathways and genes may inform development of differing biomarkers and treatment strategies in shorter versus longer standing CD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Liver Transpl\r\n    Evolving trends and comparative outcomes of bridging transarterial locoregional therapy in liver transplant candidates with hepatocellular carcinoma.\r\n The use of transarterial radioembolization as bridging therapy in HCC liver transplant candidates has surged, and is influenced by socioeconomic factors, comorbidities, and tumor burden. Transarterial radioembolization effectiveness has been demonstrated by its advantages in waitlist retention and tumor necrosis. Further studies are warranted to evaluate its impact on post-liver transplant recurrence and to validate the cost-effectiveness among transarterial therapies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Gender disparity in access to early liver transplant among patients with alcohol associated liver disease and limited sobriety is mediated by psychosocial factors.\r\nNotable gender disparities in access to LT exist among patients with ALD evaluated with <6 months of sobriety. Lower waitlisting in women is mediated by higher rates of psychiatric conditions and lower rates of employment, though gender-specific alcohol-related bias may also contribute.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Pancreas\r\n    \"Pancreatic Calcification and Pathologic Fibrosis Score: Correlation with Islet Yield and Insulin Independence after Total Pancreatectomy with Islet Autotransplantation TPIAT\".\r\n Increasing severity of calcification burden in the pancreatic body/tail was associated with around 1500 IEQ/kg reduction in islet yield following TPIAT for chronic pancreatitis. The presence of pancreatic head calcifications may be associated with more favorable islet yield.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Single Versus Dual Drainage of Walled-Off Pancreatic Necrosis.\r\nIn patients receiving initial EUS drainage, the rate of step-up to DMD was 33.9%, highlighting that 2/3 of those with WOPN can be successfully managed by endoscopic means alone.
