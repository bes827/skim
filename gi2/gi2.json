This effect appeared to be driven by replacement of SFA with CHO or TFA. Research investigating the atherogenicity of diet induced Lp(a) changes is needed to inform dietary management of lipid/lipoprotein disorders. (PROSPERO Registration number  CRD42020154169).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Rescue Therapies for Steroid-Refractory Acute Severe Ulcerative Colitis: A Systemic Review and Network Meta-analysis.\r\n This is the first network meta-analysis to investigate the efficacy of advanced therapies in reducing short-term colectomy rates in patients with SR ASUC. Tofacitinib, accelerated IFX, standard IFX, and tacrolimus significantly reduced the colectomy rates in SR ASUC patients compared with placebo. Thus, advanced therapies should be considered for rescue therapies in patients with SR ASUC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Associations of sugary beverage consumption with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and asthma-COPD overlap syndrome: A prospective cohort study.\r\n Consumption of SSBs and ASBs was associated with increased risks of COPD, asthma, and potentially ACOS, whereas moderate NJ consumption was associated with a reduced risk of COPD, depending on the juice type.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe impact of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and calcium on the risk of age-related macular degeneration: A Mendelian randomization study.\r\nThis study provides evidence supporting the causal relationship between calcium concentrations and the risk of AMD and its subtypes, which may have important implications for the prevention, monitoring, and treatment of AMD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTraditional rural dietary pattern and all-cause mortality in a prospective cohort study of elderly Costa Ricans: the Costa Rican Longevity and Healthy Aging Study (CRELES).\r\nOur results suggest that a traditional Costa Rican rural dietary pattern is associated with lower all-cause mortality in elderly Costa Ricans. Beans, a major component of this traditional dietary pattern, was also associated with lower all-cause mortality. These findings could have important implications for public health, given the nutritional transition and the reduction of intake of traditional diets in Latin American countries.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nULTRA-PROCESSED FOOD CONSUMPTION AND RISK OF GALLSTONE DISEASE: ANALYSIS OF THREE PROSPECTIVE COHORTS.\r\n UPF consumption is associated with a higher risk of gallstone disease, particularly consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and artificially-sweetened beverages. A substantial proportion of this risk is potentially mediated by obesity in younger females.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Following Through: The Impact of Culinary Medicine on Mediterranean Diet Uptake in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\nThis study showcases high patient and caregiver interest in dietary management of IBD and demonstrates efficacy of education via application of culinary medicine.

Our findings provide insight into the pathophysiology of IBD associated with PSC and suggest possible targets for modulating the risk and course of IBD in subjects with PSC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    Ex-situ machine perfusion in clinical liver transplantation: Current practices and future directions.\r\nThis innovative technology has changed the landscape of liver transplantation by mitigating ischemia perfusion injury, offering a platform for continuous assessment of organ quality, and providing an avenue for optimizing use of traditionally marginal allografts. This review summarizes the contemporary clinical applications of machine perfusion devices, and discusses potential future strategies for real-time viability assessment, therapeutic interventions, and modulation of organ function after recovery.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe type, duration, and severity of pretransplant kidney injury predict prolonged kidney dysfunction after liver transplantation.\r\nEligibility for KALT was similar between those who received 0 days and ≤ 14 days of KRT after LT (2.1% vs 2.9%, p = 0.53). In conclusion, the type, duration, and severity of pre-LT kidney dysfunction have unique impacts on post-LT kidney-related morbidity, and future research must use these novel classifications to study mitigation strategies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreas\r\n    Cancer-Derived Small Extracellular Vesicles Affect Vascular Endothelial Cells and Promote Adhesiveness of Pancreatic Cancer Cells.\r\nWe investigated association between PC-derived sEVs and adhesiveness. Regulation of PC-derived sEVs has potential as a therapeutic modality to suppress the metastasis of PC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCertolizumab Has Favorable Efficacy on Preventing Pancreas and Target Organs Damage in Acute Pancreatitis.\r\nCertolizumab has favorable protective effects on pancreas and target organs in AP. It may be a beneficial agent for AP treatment and may prevent target organ damage.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEstablishment and Diagnostic Value of an Early Prediction Model for Acute Pancreatitis Complicated With Acute Kidney Injury.\r\nThe prediction model based on age, triglyceride glucose, and procalcitonin is valuable for the prediction of AP-related AKI.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMetabolic Tumor Volume on 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography as a Prognostic Marker of Survival in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Neuroendocrine Neoplasms Treated With 177Lutetium-DOTA-Octreotate Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy.\r\nLow MTV/TLG on pre-treatment FDG-PET was associated with longer PFS in metastatic NEN patients receiving PRRT.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Potential Clinical Benefits of Direct Surgical Transgastric Pancreatic Necrosectomy for Patients With Infected Necrotizing Pancreatitis.\r\nSTGN allows for treatment of retrogastric infected necrosis in one procedure and with rapid episode resolution.
