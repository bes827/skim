However, this approach would have led to potential over- and under-treatment in a substantial proportion of patients. This underscores the importance of frequent and comprehensive monitoring, along with flexible treatment strategies that adapt to changes in disease status.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeta-analysis\r\nmeta-analyses and systematic reviews\r\n\r\n\r\n    Pancreatology\r\n    Concomitant virus infection increases mortality and worsens outcome of acute pancreatitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis.\r\n Patients co-diagnosed with AP and SARS-CoV-2 infection require heightened attention due to an increased risk of mortality and complications. No evidence was found that HIV infection elevated the risk of a more severe outcome.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Associations of early childhood exposure to severe acute malnutrition and recovery with cardiometabolic risk markers in later childhood: 5-year prospective matched cohort study in Ethiopia.\r\n Both rapid BAZ increase and decrease during early post-recovery from SAM were associated with greater cardiometabolic risk 5-years later. The findings indicate the need to target post-recovery interventions to optimize healthy weight recovery.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCold induces increased ad libitum energy intake independent of changes in energy expenditure: a controlled crossover trial in adults.\r\n Ad libitum EI increased during but not following mild cold exposure. There was an effect of 24-h RER and CARBOX during cold exposure that was related to greater ad libitum EI following cold. These results indicate an acute effect of cold on concurrent EI independent of changes in metabolic rate, but also a residual influence of cold on subsequent EI via fuel preference. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDiet Quality Patterns and Chronic Kidney Disease Incidence: A UK Biobank Cohort Study.\r\nIn British adults, higher adherence to the aMED, DASH and hPDI patterns was associated with lower risk of CKD, whereas greater adherence to the uPDI and DII patterns was associated with greater risk.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIncreasing Diversity in the Nutrition, Obesity, and Diabetes Biomedical Workforce: The BRIDGES Consortium.\r\nThere are also elements that are specific to each individual program. The BRIDGES program is expected to impact a substantial number of UR scientists who are then likely to have an influence on nutrition, obesity, diabetes and health disparities research, shaping NIH priorities, and future scientists conducting NIDDK-related research.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nStandardized Assessment of Energy Excretion in Healthy Adults: A Novel Methodology.\r\nThis study presents a standardized and efficient methodology for accurately assessing energy excretion using dye-labeled replacement bars. The findings underscore the notable yet variable role of energy excretion in energy balance and suggest that this method could enhance the precision of future energy balance studies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Eleven Grand Challenges for Inflammatory Bowel Disease Genetics and Genomics.\r\nThese involve elucidation of the genetic architecture of IBD (how it compares across populations, the role of rare variants, and prospects of polygenic risk scores), in-depth cellular and molecular characterization (fine-mapping causal variants, cellular contributions to pathology, molecular pathways, interactions with environmental exposures, and advanced organoid models), and applications in personalized medicine (unmet medical needs, working toward molecular nosology, and precision therapeutics). We review recent advances in each of the 11 areas and pose challenges for the genetics and genomics communities of IBD researchers.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEtrasimod as a Monotherapy or With Concomitant Use of Corticosteroids and/or Aminosalicylates: Results From the ELEVATE UC Clinical Program.\r\nEtrasimod monotherapy showed consistent efficacy and safety vs placebo;  no apparent benefit was observed with concomitant CS and/or 5-ASA in patients receiving etrasimod. Clinical trial registration\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGender and Sex Differences in Abdominal Pain, Fatigue, And Psychological Symptoms Among Adults with Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Network Analysis.\r\nThis study highlights that fatigue and anxiety are core symptoms among individuals with IBD and demonstrates a potential sex and/or gender difference in core symptoms. Replication of this study is needed with further consideration of inclusion of TGD patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImprovement of Transmural Inflammation With Adalimumab Versus Immunomodulator Maintenance Therapy in Pediatric Crohn's Disease: Single-Center Prospective Evaluation Using the Pediatric Inflammatory Crohn's Magnetic Resonance Enterography Index.\r\nADA therapy was associated with objective improvement in MRE findings of inflammation more frequently than IM. The low rate of MRE normalization suggests that this is not yet a realistic target with existing therapies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIntestinal Ultrasound Measures are Strongly Correlated With Small Bowel Endoscopic Lewis Score in Active Crohn's Disease.\r\nIUS measures are strongly correlated with VCE-inflammatory LS in active CD and may provide an assessment of endoscopic response and remission over time.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLow Surgery Rates in Early Crohn's Disease: Results from a Prospective Population-Based Inception Cohort-The Inflammatory Bowel Disease in South-Eastern Norway III Study.\r\n A high proportion of patients had ileal disease and inflammatory behavior at diagnosis. Still, nearly 40% started biologic therapy within the 1-year follow-up, while only 5% required intra-abdominal surgery.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNew Insights into the Pathogenesis of Intestinal Fibrosis in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: Focusing on Intestinal Smooth Muscle Cells.\r\nMoreover, the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways that regulate SMC hyperplasia/hypertrophy will be extensively reviewed. The understanding of the cellular network and the molecular background behind stricture formation is essential for the design of effective anti-fibrotic strategies, and SMCs might be a promising therapeutic target in the future.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nProvider Education and Clinical Decision Support Tool Improve Proficiency in Advanced Therapies for Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\nWe have built a freely accessible web-based decision support tool platform for advanced medical therapy selection in IBD that significantly improved provider mastery in decision-making for advanced medical therapies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Clinical outcomes after first-line anti-TNF treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease - a prospective multicenter cohort study.\r\nClinical response was achieved in two in three UC and three in four CD patients, meanwhile, one-third of UC and one-fourth of CD patients experienced LOR despite the short disease duration in this study. Several clinical features were associated with outcomes and may be useful predictors of anti-TNF treatment response.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDisruption of epithelial barrier integrity via altered GILZ/c-Rel/RACK1 signaling in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).\r\nWe provide the first evidence that an alteration of RACK1/SRC/E-cadherin regulatory mechanism, correlating with decreased GILZ protein expression is involved in epithelial barrier disruption. The clinical relevance is based on the fact that this mechanism involving GILZ/cRel-related RACK1 expression could be considered to improve IBD therapies, particularly in patients with low or no response to glucocorticoid treatment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMultiple Ileal and Colonic Stenoses: Is It Always Crohn's Disease?\r\nThis case highlights the importance of considering metastatic disease in the differential diagnosis of gastrointestinal (GI) strictures, particularly when inflammatory bowel disease markers are inconclusive or marginal. Clinicians should be aware of the potential for breast cancer to metastasize to the GI tract, which may present with symptoms mimicking primary GI diseases.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOpen label vancomycin in primary sclerosing cholangitis-inflammatory bowel disease: improved colonic disease activity and associations with changes in host-microbiome-metabolomic signatures.\r\n Four weeks of OV induces remission in PSC-IBD activity, associated with a reduction in gut bacterial diversity and compositional changes relating to BA and SCFA homeostasis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    Hepatitis C-positive grafts for hepatitis C-negative recipients in liver transplantation: Buried treasure or depleting resource?\r\nFurthermore, Ishak stage 2 or 3 fibrotic DBD grafts had similar 5-year GS to non-fibrotic grafts. The findings suggest that the long-term outcome of using HCV-viremic DBD or DCD grafts for HCV-negative recipients is comparable to that of other graft types, and that fibrotic grafts have the potential to expand the DBD donor pool.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImmune checkpoint inhibitors in the post-transplant landscape of hepatocellular carcinoma: A systematic literature review.\r\nICIs show potential for treating recurrent HCC after liver transplantation, but the risk of graft rejection is significant. Careful patient selection, close monitoring, and individualized management of immunosuppression are crucial. Positive PD-L1 expression and the choice of immunosuppressive regimen appear to influence the risk of graft rejection;  however, these findings are based on limited data. Prospective studies with larger sample sizes are needed to validate these findings and establish evidence-based guidelines for the use of ICIs in the post-transplant setting.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMaterial economic hardship is associated with adverse 1-year outcomes after pediatric liver transplantation: Prospective cohort results from the multi-center SOCIAL-Tx study.\r\nOur findings highlight the adverse influence of household material economic hardship on pediatric liver transplant outcomes within the first year. Targeted social risk assistance and adjustment strategies offer actionable avenues to mitigate these challenges and enhance outcomes in pediatric liver transplant recipients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSurvival outcomes following liver retransplantation (reSOFT) score: A model predicting survival after adult liver retransplantation.\r\nThe reSOFT score was developed by assigning points to these factors proportional to their hazard ratios and divided into high-, moderate-, and low-risk groups that accurately predict 3-month survival post-retransplant. With a C-statistic of 0.73 (CI 0.71-0.75), this tool may serve to guide clinicians in identifying and better caring for high-risk re-transplant recipients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    Impact of islet autotransplantation on 30-day post-operative outcomes in patients undergoing total pancreatectomy: A NSQIP retrospective cohort analysis of 584 patients.\r\n The results from this study suggest that TPIAT does not appear to be associated with increased 30-day morbidity, and should be considered in patients to mitigate the long-term morbidity associated with diabetes mellitus post TP.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMethionine restriction inhibits pancreatic cancer proliferation while suppressing JAK2/STAT3 pathway.\r\n MR suppressed the JAK2/STAT3 pathway and decreased NF-kB in some PC cell lines.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatic extracellular volume fraction on routine contrast-enhanced computed tomography can predict pancreatic fibrosis and postoperative pancreatic fistula.\r\nPancreatic ECV obtained from routine CE-CT images accurately predicted the histopathological grade of pancreatic fibrosis and was an independent risk factor for POPF after PD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThree-tiered critical care management of acute pancreatitis.\r\n Our findings suggest that on-admission CRP and amylase cannot reliably predict progression of AP. However, elevated and increasing levels of CRP and amylase may indicate the need for early HDU admission to enable closer monitoring.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous\r\nmisc publications eg case reports, tools of the trade, images of\r\nthe month, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    A broader perspective on nutrition research: the rationale for integrating the entire continuum of human nutrition.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Advancing Toward Transmural Healing in Pediatric Crohn's Disease.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    Caveat of biliary ph as biomarker of bile duct viability during normothermic machine perfusion of donor livers.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInequity in access to liver transplant care: Time to make the invisible visible.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLetter to the Editor: Normothermic regional perfusion in controlled DCD liver procurement- Comparable outcomes to DBD liver transplantation in three different European countries.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLetter to the Editor: Normothermic regional perfusion in controlled DCD liver procurement: Comparable outcomes to DBD liver transplantation in three different European countries.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe impact of normothermic machine perfusion on coagulation function and transfusion practice: Miracle Machine or anticipatory bias.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreas\r\n    Pancreatitis during COVID-19 pandemic in US. some comments.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetters&Replies\r\nLetters to the editors and authors’ replies\r\n\r\n\r\n    Pancreatology\r\n    Autoimmune pancreatitis associated with severe postoperative pneumonia.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

PBMAs may facilitate the transition to a plant-based diet, but long-term studies are needed to evaluate their cardiometabolic effects.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Oral Citrulline supplementation in pregnancies with preeclampsia: a multicentre, randomized, double blind clinical trial.\r\n The current trial found no benefit of oral L-citrulline supplementation to women with preeclampsia regarding either the duration of pregnancy, fetal growth, or maternal and neonatal outcome. Systolic blood pressure and liver enzymes at delivery were increased in the treated group. L-citrulline oral supplementation does not seem to be a promising candidate as a therapeutic intervention in pregnancies with preeclampsia. Clinical Trial Registration\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPrediction models of basal energy expenditure in children and adolescents across the BMI spectrum based on room-calorimetry: a cross-sectional cohort study.\r\n New BEE prediction models developed and tested in cohorts representative of children with normal weight and OW/OB had superior performance compared with existing models. The BEE prediction equations based on simple anthropometrics or body composition provided improved accuracy and precision for children with NW or OW/OB, ages 5 to 19. More accurate estimates of BEE should allow for better estimates of energy requirements of children.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Anti-integrin αvβ6 Antibodies Predict Pouchitis in Patients With Ulcerative Colitis After Restorative Proctocolectomy With Ileal Pouch-Anal Anastomosis. \r\nThe anti-integrin αvβ6 antibody levels in patients with UC were decreased after RPC but remained high in patients who developed pouchitis. The antibody levels at the time of RPC may serve as a potential prognostic biomarker for predicting the risk of pouchitis in patients with UC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAutologous Microfragmented Adipose Tissue Injection in Refractory Complex Crohn's Perianal Fistulas: Long-Term Results at 6.7 Years Mean Follow-up. \r\nOur results show that patients who achieved closure in the first 24 weeks sustained response at long-term evaluation. In addition, there may be a rationale in repeating treatment as rescue therapy in not responding to patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDexamethasone Upregulates the Expression of the Human SLC26A3 (DRA, Down-Regulated in Adenoma) Transporter (an IBD Susceptibility Gene) in Intestinal Epithelial Cells and Attenuates Gut Inflammation. \r\nDEX treatment to mice for 7 days in the αIL-10R mAb model of colitis was able to significantly attenuate the gut inflammation and associated decrease in DRA expression. We demonstrate that DEX stimulates DRA expression via transcriptional mechanisms and suggest that upregulation of DRA may contribute to both anti-inflammatory and pro-absorptive effects of DEX.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEstimation of the Harvey Bradshaw Index from the Patient-Reported Outcome 2 in Crohn's Disease: Results Based on a Large Scale Randomized Controlled Trial. \r\nPRO2 and HBI correlate strongly and conversion between them is possible. These findings facilitate the practical application of trial results and clinical guidelines.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHistological, But Neither Clinical Nor Endoscopic Activity Predicts the Risk of Colectomy in Patients With Ulcerative Colitis Treated With Biologics. \r\nSevere histological activity at baseline as characterized by a higher Nancy Index or Geboes score independently predicted colectomy risk in biological-treated UC patients, whereas MES did not. Thus, histological assessment should be encouraged before initiating biological treatment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMediators of Filgotinib Treatment Effects in Ulcerative Colitis: Exploring Circulating Biomarkers in the Phase 2b/3 SELECTION Study. \r\nSeveral proinflammatory and neutrophil activation biomarkers may be early mediators of filgotinib treatment effects. NCT02914522.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Modifiable psychological factors are associated with clusters of pain, fatigue, faecal incontinence and IBS-type symptoms in inflammatory bowel disease: a latent profile analysis. \r\nRecognising the potential impact of cognitive behavioural factors in exacerbating symptoms can lead to earlier identification of patients who require support and allows treatment plans to be tailored more precisely. The findings from this study promote a more integrated approach to IBD management, combining medical treatment with cognitive behavioural interventions to enhance patient care and improve outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    Preservation of coagulation function by normothermic machine perfusion in liver transplant as evidenced by thromboelastography parameters.\r\nFollowing reperfusion, there was a significant decrease in the transfusion of blood products in the NMP group compared with that in the static cold storage group. Overall, we determined that the use of intraoperative thromboelastography can provide real-time data to assess one aspect of reperfusion liver quality and viability.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nProlonged time from cross clamp until normothermic machine perfusion start is associated with increased risk of early allograft dysfunction following DCD liver transplant.\r\n Following cross clamp, DCD liver grafts should be placed on the NMP pump as quickly as is safely and logistically possible. In cases where delays are unavoidable such as waiting for biopsy results or liver reallocation with another center, acceptable results can still be achieved and therefore livers with prolonged times should still be utilized.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSimplified ischemia-free liver transplantation by providing alternating flow of the portal vein and hepatic artery: Applicability, efficiency, safety.\r\nThe SIFLT simplifies the intricate surgical procudure while ensuring protection of livers from IRI. This technique holds promise for enabling patients to achieve clinical outcomes comparable to those of CIFLT.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    Genotype-based prognosis prediction for MEN1-Related pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors in Korean patients a single-center retrospective study.\r\n PNETs in Korean patients with MEN1 exhibit a stable prognosis. An individualized follow-up strategy may be necessary, particularly for young patients with truncating mutation in the MEN1 gene. In addition, those with mutations in exons 3 or 10 may require more active surveillance to decrease the risk of progression.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRepeated pancreatic juice cytology via endoscopic nasopancreatic drainage catheter combined with clinical findings improves diagnostic ability for malignant cases of suspected pancreatic cancer with non-identifiable tumors.\r\nCombining SPACE with clinical and imaging findings significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy in suspected PC cases where conventional imaging fails to detect tumors. This integrated approach has the potential to enhance clinical outcomes by facilitating more accurate patient management.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSerum IgG4-negative and IgG4-positive type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis present with different clinicopathological features: An analysis of a nationwide survey in Japan.\r\nPatients with sIgG4-negative type 1 AIP and those with sIgG4-positive type 1 AIP present with different clinicopathological features which suggests heterogeneity of patients with type 1 AIP. Low serum IgG4 levels could indicate low disease activity in type 1 AIP.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nYKL-40 as a risk stratification marker in acute pancreatitis: A prospective study.\r\nSerum YKL-40 is a plausible candidate for further evaluation as an early biochemical indicator of subsequent AP severity, particularly if considered jointly with CRP and/or IL-6.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous\r\nmisc publications eg case reports, tools of the trade, images of\r\nthe month, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    J Crohns Colitis\r\n    Decreased Levels Of Atmospheric Pollution And Reduced Prevalence Of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases In Europe. \r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    Letter to the editor: Plasma exchange for alcohol-related liver disease as a bridge to liver transplantation: A call to expand its adaptation in Japan.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreas\r\n    Bile Leak From A Duct of Luschka After Whipple Pancreaticoduodinectomy: A Case Report.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetters&Replies\r\nLetters to the editors and authors’ replies\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

These positive clinical outcomes, along with a favorable safety profile, suggest that high-protein supplementation may be a valuable addition to medical practice. However, given the need for more robust trials and the high ROB observed in the existing studies, these conclusions should be interpreted with caution. This review was prospectively registered with PROSPERO under the registration number CRD42021237372.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreas\r\n    Evaluating Continuous Glucose Monitoring after Total Pancreatectomy with or without islet autotransplatation: A Scoping Systematic Review.\r\nCGM can be used following TP for glucose monitoring and/or linked with insulin pump device in the peri-operative period with improved glycaemic control. However, the data are limited by short follow-up and lack of PROMs and QoL measures.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Effect of Epidural Analgesia on In-Hospital Outcomes in Patients with Acute Pancreatitis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials.\r\nEA did not significantly improve in-hospital outcomes in AP patients. However, findings indicated reduced opioid consumption in the EA group, suggesting potential benefits in pain management. Further high-quality, large-scale randomized trials are needed to understand the potential benefits of EA in this population.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    Presentation and management of pancreatic hydatid cyst: A comprehensive systematic review of the literature with meta-data.\r\n Although pancreatic hydatid cysts are rare and can be challenging to diagnose, their prognosis is generally favorable when appropriate therapeutic measures are employed. Surgical intervention, often combined with Albendazole, remains the mainstay of treatment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Association of the glucose patterns after a single non-standardized meal with the habitual diet composition and features of the daily glucose profile in individuals without diabetes.\r\nTwo PPGR patterns after a single non-standardized breakfast were identified in high-cardiometabolic risk individuals. The habitual diet was associated with the patterns and their dynamic parameters, which, in turn, could predict the individuals' DGP. Our findings could support the implementation of dietary strategies targeting the PPGR to ameliorate the cardiometabolic risk profile.

Drought and agricultural data indicated less favorable conditions for toxin production, resulting in low levels of exposure in both trial arms. Annual, seasonal, and geographic heterogeneity of AF contamination make it difficult to study in an ethically-designed trial. Our formative research and early trial data indicate that stunting and intermittent AF exposure continue to be a problem in this area. However, the low AF exposure levels during the trial led to inconclusive results.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    Metabolic issues in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) and their impact on MASH recurrence following Liver Transplantation: A narrative review.\r\nRecurrence of MASH following liver transplant can occur due to many reasons including reversal of the catabolic state seen in cirrhosis, improvement in appetite, and the effect of certain post-LT medications on the graft;  however, managing recurrence can be challenging and thus urges addressing these issues prior to transplant, in addition to recognizing, and treating them in the post-transplant setting. In this review, we discuss the various metabolic issues that face patients with MASH, the medical and surgical management options available to improve outcomes and reduce chances of recurrence.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreas\r\n    Circulating Chromogranin A is associated with disease extent, progression and recurrence in patients with non-functioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (NF-PNET).\r\nSerum Chromogranin A correlates with disease extent in NF-PNET, and is useful for surveillance after resection of NF-PNET.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCirculating biomarkers of macrophage activation in different stages of chronic pancreatitis: A pilot study.\r\n Our study demonstrates that subjects with definitive CP, sampled during a clinically quiescent phase, exhibited increased levels of sCD163 and sCD206. This indicates the presence of activated M2 macrophages in patients with CP at advanced, but not early, clinical stages.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDecisional Control Preferences in Managing Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms of the Pancreas.\r\nMost patients preferred an active role in IPMN treatment decisions. Lower health literacy and Latino race were associated with a preference for non-active decision roles. Clinicians should strive to align patient involvement in IPMN treatment decisions with their patient's preferred role.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHigh Diagnostic Yield of Fine Needle Biopsy for Pancreatic Serous Cystadenomas - a Multi-Center Study.\r\n EUS-FNB sampling for histopathology is a safe and accurate diagnostic tool for pancreatic serous cystadenoma. When microcytic lesions are found on endoscopic ultrasound, our study results suggest that fine needle biopsy for histopathology should be considered as the initial diagnostic evaluation tool given the demonstrated improved diagnostic yield for serous cystadenoma.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nINVESTIGATION OF GEOSPATIAL DISPARITIES IN CHRONIC PANCREATITIS OUTCOMES.\r\nDespite multidisciplinary guideline-based care, residence in the most vulnerable neighborhoods may be associated with less opioid use and more frequent CP flares, suggesting possible inadequate pain control in these patients. These findings should guide prospective investigation of the impact of geospatial social determinants of health in CP and efforts to mitigate the above disparities.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOncogenic KRAS Promotes Ferroptosis in Pancreatic Cancer through Regulation of the FOSL1-TFRC Axis.\r\nFurthermore, the KRAS/FOSL1/TFRC axis can make the PDAC cells vulnerable to alteration of the iron level in the tumor microenvironment. Our study highlights a pivotal mechanism of PDAC ferroptosis through iron metabolism and supports a new therapeutic strategy for PDAC with superior potential.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPhase II randomized controlled trial to evaluate the supportive effect of Koujin (TJ-3020) powder in gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel-treated unresectable or recurrent pancreatic cancer.\r\nIn this phase II randomized trial, oral administration of red ginseng powder at 2.0 g per day did not reduce pancreatic cancer patients' fatigue or malaise induced by GnP combination chemotherapy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRisk factors for early liver recurrence after pancreatic cancer resection.\r\n The risk factors for postoperative early liver recurrence were R-PV, a tumor diameter ≥ 45 mm and pathological venous invasion. Surgery for pancreatic cancer with these factors may require special treatment, such as hepatic arterial injection.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSOMATOSTATIN ANALOGUES VS ACTIVE SURVEILLANCE IN SMALL PANCREATIC NEUROENDOCRINE TUMORS.\r\nOur monocentric experience demonstrated a significant antiproliferative activity of somatostatin analogues in patients with sporadic, non-functionating G1-G2 PanNETs ≤2 cm delaying tumor progression and distant spread in small lesions that sometimes may reveal unpredictable aggressiveness.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSerum trypsin is a reliable biomarker of pancreas function.\r\nOn one hand, assessment of trypsin concentration in the serum sensitively and specifically detects pancreas inflammation;  whereas on the other hand, declining trypsin levels in serum showed good correlation with direct pancreatic function tests to identify exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. With this comprehensive review, we aimed to evaluate the existing evidence on the utility of trypsin as a continuous biomarker, spanning from acute to chronic pancreatitis and pancreas function, highlighting its potential in monitoring disease evolution on an individual patient level.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTumor budding is an independent adverse prognostic factor of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients treated by resection after preoperative chemoradiotherapy.\r\nThis study revealed that the presence of tumor budding was an independent adverse prognostic factor in PDAC patients resected after gemcitabine and S1-based CRT.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    Characteristics and prognosis of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma not expressing CA19-9: Analysis of the National Cancer Database.\r\nCA 19-9 non-expression is associated with distant metastatic disease at diagnosis and with death in resected non-metastatic patients compared to normal-range CA 19-9 levels. This clinically relevant subgroup requires alternative biomarkers, and may need consideration of more extensive preoperative staging and intensive perioperative systemic therapy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCirculating necroptosis markers in chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer: Associations with diagnosis and prognostic factors.\r\nCirculating levels of MLKL are lower in patients with CP than PDAC. Elevated sST2 levels are associated with pancreatic diseases. Further studies are required to show whether MLKL and sST2 could be useful biomarkers in evaluating pancreatic diseases.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDevelopment of a core outcome set for recurrent acute and chronic pancreatitis: Results of a Delphi poll.\r\nUsing the OMERACT framework, we developed a core outcome set for RAP and CP. Future research will focus on identifying validated measures for each domain, facilitating standardized assessments across clinical trials.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGenotype-based prognosis prediction for MEN1-Related pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors in Korean patients a single-center retrospective study. \r\nAn individualized follow-up strategy may be necessary, particularly for young patients with truncating mutation in the MEN1 gene. In addition, those with mutations in exons 3 or 10 may require more active surveillance to decrease the risk of progression.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nProgression of resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma during surgical delay and effects on survival - A propensity score matched study.\r\n Progression in tumor size does not seem to affect survival in our study population. In general, surgical treatment delay in up-front resectable patients does not seem to be associated with survival or the risk of recurrence, but the optimal and maximal time to surgery as well as the optimal timing of the follow-up scanning remain unclear.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nYKL-40 as a risk stratification marker in acute pancreatitis: A prospective study. \r\nThe high YKL-40 - outcome association at both time-points was conditional on concurrent IL-6: uncertain if IL-6 was low, strong if IL-6 was high. Serum YKL-40 is a plausible candidate for further evaluation as an early biochemical indicator of subsequent AP severity, particularly if considered jointly with CRP and/or IL-6.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    High-protein supplementation during cancer therapy - strengthening of the evidence-base to support its safety and clinical benefits.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPlant and animal proteins: seeing both the trees and the forest.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous\r\nmisc publications eg case reports, tools of the trade, images of\r\nthe month, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Expression of Concern: The antidiabetic β3-adrenoceptor agonist BRL 26830A works by release of endogenous insulin (Am J Clin Nutr 1992;55:237S-41S).\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    A history of transplant oncology-the story of steve jobs.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPolicy corner: Hepatic hydrothorax MELD exception.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTherapy of alcohol use disorder in liver transplant recipients.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreas\r\n    Assessing the feasibility of handheld point-of-care ultrasound for pancreas visualization: A pilot study.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nERCP Directed Transpapillary Pancreatic Duct Stenting for Disconnected Pancreatic Duct after Pancreatic Enucleation.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLipomatous pseudohypertrophy of the pancreas: a rare disease with a novel imaging finding.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancrelipase Delayed-Release Capsules Improve Stool Frequency and Consistency in Patients with Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency Due to Chronic Pancreatitis or Pancreatic Surgery: Post-hoc Analysis of Patient-Reported Daily Symptoms in a Double-Blind Randomized Trial.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetters&Replies\r\nLetters to the editors and authors’ replies\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Challenges in assessing the impact of maternal fish consumption and ω-3 supplement use on autism-related outcomes in children.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImpact of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and calcium on risk of age-related macular degeneration.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    Author's reply: Exploring the role of neoadjuvant therapy for resectable pancreatic cancer.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
