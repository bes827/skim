The lack of effect on naïve rats suggests a selective analgesic effect in the inflamed gut. Our results suggest that in the colitis model, TRPV1 channels are tonically active. Furthermore, our results emphasize the role of TRPV1-expressing nociceptive fibers in colitis-induced pain. These findings provide proof of concept for using charged activity blockers for the blockade of IBD-associated abdominal pain.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHypoxic Functional Regulation Pathways in the GI Tract: Focus on the HIF-1α and Microbiota's Crosstalk.\r\nIn turn, gut commensals establish and maintain the physiologic hypoxia of the GI tract and HIF-α expression. Based on this premise, the goals of this review are to (1) highlight hypoxic molecular pathways in the GI tract, both in physiologic and pathophysiologic settings, such as inflammatory bowel disease;  and (2) discuss a potential strategy for ameliorating gut-related disorders, by targeting HIF signaling, which can alleviate inflammatory processes, restore autophagy correct mechanisms, and benefit the host-microbiota equilibrium.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTwo-Year Efficacy and Safety of Mirikizumab Following 104 Weeks of Continuous Treatment for Ulcerative Colitis: Results From the LUCENT-3 Open-Label Extension Study.\r\nEndoscopic, histologic, symptomatic, and quality-of-life outcomes support the long-term benefit of mirikizumab treatment up to 104 weeks in patients with ulcerative colitis, including biologic-failed patients, with no new safety concerns.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Contrast enhanced endoscopic ultrasound detects early therapy response following anti-TNF-therapy in patients with ulcerative colitis.\r\n dCEUS enables the early detection of therapy response in patients with aUC, which serves as a predictive marker for long term clinical success.
