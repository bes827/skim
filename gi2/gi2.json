These results highlight the diagnostic uncertainty surrounding pseudopolyps in IBD and call for careful endoscopic assessment rather than routine resection.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Modified-2-stage versus 3-stage approach in ileoanal pouch surgery for Ulcerative Colitis.\nBoth approaches have comparable high stoma-free rates at the end of follow-up. Modified-2-stage avoids a temporary stoma in more than 75% of patients, but has a significantly higher rate of anastomotic leakages. Active and early surveillance of the anastomosis after 3-stage procedures could improve postoperative outcomes in this group.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Serum Protein Profiles Differ with Adalimumab and Ustekinumab Treatment in Moderately to Severely Active Crohn's Disease.\nAlthough patients receiving either adalimumab or ustekinumab reached similar rates of clinical remission at Week 52, the two therapies resulted in unique serum proteomic expression profiles reflecting mechanistic differences.
