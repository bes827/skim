Although participants deferred to center protocols in many cases, there was great interest in safely expanding access to LT for patients with larger tumor burden and biologically amenable lesions.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeta-analysis\r\nmeta-analyses and systematic reviews\r\n\r\n\r\n    Pancreatology\r\n    Inflammatory markers in predicting survival in pancreatic cancer: A Systematic review and Meta-Analysis. \r\nFurthermore, NLR and PLR show significant association with malignancy in PCN (OR 3.07 and HR 2.42, respectively). NLR and PLR effectively predicted PC outcomes and hold potential for evaluating therapeutic responses and identifying candidates for additional treatment strategies in advanced disease.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    A Bayesian Analysis of the VITAL Trial: Effects of Omega-3 Fatty Acid Supplementation on Cardiovascular Events.\r\n Bayesian analyses of VITAL incorporating previous RCT evidence suggest that daily omega-3 FA supplementation robustly lowers risk of coronary events but not stroke, providing enhanced support for the primary prevention use of omega-3 FA supplementation for coronary events. (VITAL clinicaltrials.gov identifier  NCT01169259).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nBiomarkers of dietary PUFA intake in childhood and adolescence in relation to cardiometabolic risk factors in young adulthood: a prospective cohort study in Sweden. \r\nPlasma phospholipid proportions of LA and ALA, biomarkers of vegetable oil intake, during childhood and adolescence were inversely associated with measures of obesity and cardiometabolic health in young adulthood, with a potential sex difference. These findings accord with short-term feeding trials suggesting a possible preventive role of LA on body fat accumulation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nContinuous glucose monitor overestimates glycemia, with the magnitude of bias varying by postprandial test and individual - A randomized crossover trial.\r\nCGM overestimated glycemic responses in numerous contexts. At times this can mischaracterize the GI. In addition, there is inter-individual heterogeneity of the accuracy of CGM to estimate fasting glucose concentrations. Correction for this difference reduces, but does not eliminate, postprandial overestimate of glycemia by CGM. Caution should be applied when inferring absolute or relative glycemic responses to foods using CGM, and capillary sampling should be prioritised for accurate quantification of glycemic response. Clinical trial registry\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPost-cardiovascular disease healthy lifestyle, inflammation and metabolic biomarkers, and risk of dementia: a population-based longitudinal study. \r\nAdherence to healthy lifestyle behaviors is significantly associated with a lower risk of dementia in individuals with CVD. The observed associations may be partly explained by a reduction in systemic inflammation and the promotion of metabolic balance.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReducing Cardiometabolic Diseases Risk dietary pattern in the Chinese population with dyslipidemia: a single-center, open-label, randomized, dietary intervention study. \r\nCompared to the control group, the RCMDR dietary pattern intervention lowered cardiometabolic risk, blood lipids, blood pressure, abdominal obesity and circulating Hcy level among Chinese population with dyslipidemia.

However, higher nut intake decreased CD risk in overweight or obese individuals. Thus, personalized-risk stratification, rather than generalized dietary recommendations, may be important for IBD prevention strategies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEfficacy and Safety of Etrasimod in Patients With Moderately to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis Stratified by Baseline Modified Mayo Score: A Post Hoc Analysis From the Phase 3 ELEVATE UC Clinical Program.\r\nAt week 12, etrasimod showed greater reductions in disease activity and higher rates of clinical response vs placebo in patients with either moderately or severely active disease at baseline. The safety profile of etrasimod was consistent with the overall trial population and was unimpacted by baseline disease activity.  NCT03945188;  NCT03996369.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHigher-Dose Infliximab Induction Achieves Better Maintenance Trough Levels in a National Pediatric IBD Cohort-A Retrospective Study.\r\nOur real-world data show that 5 mg/kg infliximab induction does not achieve target TLs in most children with CD. Higher-dose regimens should be considered, especially if proactive therapeutic drug monitoring is not available.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Higher Dietary Glycemic Index, but not Glycemic Load, is Associated with Increased Risk of Ulcerative Colitis: A Prospective Cohort Study. \r\nNo significant associations were found between dietary glycemic load with risk of CD and UC. A higher dietary glycemic index, but not glycemic load, is associated with an increased risk of UC, underscoring the importance of considering glycemic index in dietary recommendations for UC prevention.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIndependent Predictors of 90-Day Readmission in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Nationwide Retrospective Study.\r\nThis study identifies several risk factors for readmission in patients with IBD, many of which are potentially modifiable psychosocial factors. Closer follow-up, possibly via virtual modalities, as well as alternative treatment strategies, should be considered in patients with IBD at higher risk of readmission.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIntestinal Ultrasound as a Prognostic Tool in New-Onset Ulcerative Colitis - A Copenhagen IBD Cohort Study.\r\nFindings by intestinal ultrasound at the time of diagnosis predict early colectomy risk in UC.

Safety lies in flattening the learning curve.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreas\r\n    Coupled Plasma Filtration and Adsorption in Eliminating Inflammatory Mediators and Enhancing Sublingual Microcirculation in Severe Acute Pancreatitis.\r\n The application of CPFA in SAP patients effectively eliminates inflammatory mediators and enhances microcirculation, leading to improved clinical outcomes and reduced mortality rates.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEfficacy of Neoadjuvant Therapy for Resectable Pancreatic Cancer Might be Limited to Biologically Borderline Resectable Cases.\r\n The efficacy of NAT for RPC might be limited to the subset of patients with high TM.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nUsefulness and Safety of Endoscopic Nasobiliary Drainage for Type 1 Autoimmune Pancreatitis.\r\nAlthough ENBD causes discomfort and the risk of self-removal, it differentiates AIP from malignant tumors, evaluates steroid effects using real-time cholangiography, and reduces the number of required ERCP procedures. ENBD could be one of the drainage options for type 1 AIP, depending on patients' background.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    Circulating cyclophilin A levels elevate in animal models and can predict mortality in patients with acute pancreatitis. \r\nCirculating CypA levels are significantly increased in mouse CER-AP and hamster HTG-AP models. We have identified a novel association of raised plasma CypA levels with severity of HTG-AP and confirmed its significant prognostic ability to predict mortality in AP patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEarly response evaluation using CT and CA 19-9 in patients with pancreatic cancer of all stages undergoing first-line FOLFIRINOX treatment. \r\nIn the CT/CA 19-9 response dataset (n = 242), integrated CT and CA 19-9 responses revealed the shortest OS in patients with either PD or increased CA 19-9 (n = 74;  median OS, 14.3 months), followed by PR/SD with decreased CA 19-9 (n = 113;  median OS, 19.8 months;  P = .003), and PR/SD with normalized CA 19-9 (n = 55;  median OS, 23.6 months;  P = .04). Our combined evaluation of CT and CA 19-9 responses successfully stratified the survival of patients with PDAC treated with FOLFIRINOX, irrespective of disease stage.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEvolving trends in interventions and outcomes for acute biliary pancreatitis during pregnancy: A two-decade analysis.\r\nPregnant women represent a significant portion of hospitalized ABP cases, paralleling increases in age, comorbidities, and obesity rates. Racial disparities are linked to higher odds of SAP, though comorbidities have a dominant effect. There has been an increase in guideline-recommended procedures (ERCP and cholecystectomy);  however, further research is needed to address the implementation gap, considering the increased complexity of pregnant women with ABP.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLaparoscopic versus open Frey procedure: Comparative analysis of short and long-term outcomes.\r\nLaparoscopic Frey procedure is an efficient and safe intervention, which provides al the advantages of the minimally invasive approach.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nVascular stent graft for the treatment of post-pancreaticoduodenectomy hemorrhage and risk factors for rebleeding.\r\nVascular stent graft is effective and safe for PPH, especially at the site of the GDA stump and the CHA-PHA. Recurrent bleeding is not rare with such treatment, and BMI and pancreatic fistula are independent risk factors for rebleeding.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Extending the prevention paradigm for cardiometabolic diseases to target dementia through multiple low-risk lifestyle behaviors: a story of adherence. \r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nUrinary creatinine excretion-a standard that requires further calibration. \r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    \"Harnessing the power of organoids for improved outcomes in pancreatic cancer\". \r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe evolving landscape of EUS utilization in the management of pancreatic cystic neoplasms. \r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous\r\nmisc publications eg case reports, tools of the trade, images of\r\nthe month, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Liver Transpl\r\n    No RETREAT: Moving forward in post-transplant HCC recurrence prediction.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe long and winding road to maximize the benefit of Liver Transplantation.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetters&Replies\r\nLetters to the editors and authors’ replies\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Phenylketonuria in adults: we know plenty, but there is much more to learn. \r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

For patients with LAPC and who are unlikely to receive resection, neoadjuvant radiotherapy seems to improve OS and PFS/DFS/RFS.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    A multi-site community-based, case-control study to examine the nutrient intake adequacy of young children with and without developmental delays and other disorders: findings from the Study to Explore Early Development (SEED). \r\nReassurance can be taken from this study that young children's nutrient intakes from food, including those with developmental disabilities, meet most recommendations for nutrient adequacy. Further study of food intake patterns and diet quality are warranted, with concurrent clinical indicators of nutrient status.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAcute decrease in the plasma tryptophan-to-large-neutral-amino-acids ratio attenuates the effects of L-tryptophan on gut hormones and energy intake in healthy males: a randomized, cross-over, exploratory trial.\r\nAcute reduction in the Trp/LNAAs ratio appears to be associated with a diminished capacity of Trp to stimulate CCK and GLP-1, and suppress energy intake. While these observations should be interpreted with caution given the exploratory nature of the study, they attest to the complexity of the relationships between pre- and post-absorptive mechanisms underlying Trp's appetite-inhibitory effect. Clinical trial registry The trial was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry ( trial number  ACTRN12620001275954).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAssociation of household food insecurity with diet quality in a nationally representative sample of US toddlers: A cross-sectional study.\r\nThe association of household food insecurity with lower diet quality in this study suggests that toddlers may not be shielded from household food shortages. Although consumption of certain food groups, such as whole grains, was inadequate in the overall sample of US toddlers, food insecurity could exacerbate suboptimal intake of whole grains. Interventions to improve diet quality of young children must account for household food insecurity.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCarbon stable isotope values in hair are associated with added sugar intake in adults but not young children: A cross-sectional study. \r\nAge-related dietary patterns, particularly higher cow's milk consumption in children, may mask δ13C ─added sugar associations, highlighting the importance of accounting for age and dietary complexity in biomarker research. \"Snacks, Smiles and Taste Preferences,\" NCT03631992 (baseline data only), Website: \"Added Sugar Intake, Sweet Taste Phenotypes and Biomarkers\" (SWBIO), NCT05047588, Website:\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nChanges in olive oil consumption and long-term body weight changes in three U.S. prospective cohort studies.\r\nA long-term increase in olive oil intake was inversely associated with body weight in middle-aged adults in the U.S. Conversely, increased consumption of other added fats, such as butter and margarine, was positively associated with body weight.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDietary Patterns and Colorectal Cancer Risk: Global Cancer Update Programme (CUP Global) Systematic Literature Review. \r\nThis review highlights the role of dietary patterns in CRC risk/mortality, providing insights for future research and public health strategies. This review was registered at PROSPERO as CRD42022324327 (Link:\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEAT-Lancet Diet Pattern, genetic risk, and risk of colorectal cancer: a prospective study from the UK Biobank.\r\n The ELD-I could reduce 13% of CRC risk, especially in individuals with a moderate genetic risk. Individuals with high ELD-I and low PRS had the lowest CRC risk than those with low ELD-I and high PRS. These findings underscore the potential role of EAT-Lancet Diet in CRC prevention.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEarly full enteral nutrition with fortified milk in very preterm infants: a randomized clinical trial.\r\n In very preterm infants receiving early full enteral nutrition, providing early human milk fortification does not result in higher than usual FFM z-scores. This feeding strategy may, however, lead to a sustained increase in length, and transient increases in weight and FFM in grams. Clinical trial registration\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReducing Cardiometabolic Diseases Risk dietary pattern in the Chinese population with dyslipidemia: a single-center, open-label, randomized, dietary intervention study. \r\nCompared to the control group, the RCMDR dietary pattern intervention lowered cardiometabolic risk, blood lipids, blood pressure, abdominal obesity and circulating Hcy level among Chinese population with dyslipidemia. Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2300072472),\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRole of hepcidin on benefits and risks of supplementation with iron syrup and multiple micronutrient powders in Bangladeshi children: a sub-study to a randomized controlled trial.\r\nImmediate effects of MNPs on child hemoglobin and iron status are larger among those with low compared to not-low hepcidin, indicating that pre-intervention screening could help identify those who would benefit most from MNPs.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Erythrocyte Methotrexate-Polyglutamate Concentrations in Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\nWe observed high interindividual variability in the reached erythrocyte MTX-PG concentrations. Body surface adjusted or unadjusted MTX dosage showed a positive linear correlation with erythrocyte MTX-PG concentrations in children with IBD. This is a prerequisite for TDM and provides a strong basis for further research into the relation between TDM of MTX, efficacy, and toxicity.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImpact of Psychosocial and Neurodevelopmental Disorders on Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis: A Single-Center, Retrospective, Observational Study.\r\nPsychosocial and neurodevelopmental disorders are prevalent in children with UC and significantly affect both disease severity and therapeutic approaches. The findings suggest that comprehensive management involving psychosocial interventions and multidisciplinary support is crucial for effectively treating these patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNovel Transcriptomic Signatures in Fibrostenotic Crohn's Disease: Dysregulated Pathways, Promising Biomarkers, and Putative Therapeutic Targets. \r\nLY96 and SRM were expressed by immune cells, whereas HDAC1, AKAP11, and SERPINE1 showed low expression across al cellular subsets. This study comprehensively characterizes resected CD ileal strictures, elucidating main dysregulated pathways and identifying promising biomarkers and putative therapeutic targets.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSingle-Cell Transcriptomic Profile of Innate Cell Populations in Mesenteric Lymph Nodes of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients.\r\n CITE-seq and flow-cytometry analyses of colonic MLNs from patients with active IBD reveal the molecular signature and cell distribution of previously uncharacterized DC and ILC subpopulations in human MLNs. These findings expand our understanding of immune responses during chronic inflammation in IBD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Uncovering the therapeutic potential of anti-tuberculoid agent Isoniazid in a model of microbial-driven Crohn's Disease. \r\nIsoniazid protects against the development of intestinal and systemic inflammation in the TNFΔARE model of terminal ileitis by limiting the expansion of mucosal-SFB and progression of the associated microbial-driven inflammation. This work highlights a possible mycobacterial-independent function of Isoniazid in limiting CD-pathophysiology through limiting the mucosal establishment of pathobionts such as SFB and the association of such microbe-derived endospores linked to the formation of ectopic tertiary lymphoid organs seen commonly in patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    Cannabis and liver transplant in the era of legalization: Effects of pre-transplant cannabis use on postoperative opioid use and transplant outcomes.\r\nWhile cannabis use pre-LT was associated with significantly higher opioid use in the immediate postoperative period, this did not translate to differences in opioid use beyond 48 hours post-LT, or short-term healthcare utilization or clinical outcomes. These findings should help set provider expectations for immediate post-LT pain control. Our findings support the growing body of literature that fails to identify an association between pre-LT cannabis use and post-LT outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCo-producing a health advocate intervention for pediatric liver transplant recipients using human-centered design.\r\nUsing structured design methodology, we designed a prototype navigator role for pediatric liver transplant care teams. Future studies should test the effectiveness of this navigator role in improving post-transplant outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLower child opportunity index is associated with increased healthcare utilization following pediatric liver transplantation.\r\nWe also observed that in the second year post-LT, children with a lower COI were more often admitted with a complication of LT (23%) than those with a higher COI (18%). COI may be a useful composite screening instrument for clinical teams to target resources and limit acute care use post-LT.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreas\r\n    A Nomogram for Predicting the Transition From Recurrent Acute Pancreatitis to Chronic Pancreatitis. \r\nThe area under the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve was >0.7 over 1000 days. A nomogram was developed and validated to evaluate the transition from recurrent acute pancreatitis to chronic pancreatitis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nBodyweight-Adjusted Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs Dose in the Prevention of Post-endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography Pancreatitis. \r\nPEP was not prevented by NSAID dosages below 1.0 mg/kg body weight whereas a dosage above 1.0 mg/kg body weight had a significant prophylactic effect. An NSAID dosage adjusted to body weight may be necessary to achieve an adequate prophylactic effect against PEP.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDifferences in the Clinicopathologic and Radiological Characteristics of Patients with Microcystic and Macrocystic Serous Cystadenoma of the Pancreas. \r\nAlthough many patients presented with typical imaging features, accurate diagnosis of SCN remained difficult. Except for older age and higher ASA grade in the MiC group, there were no significant differences in the clinicopathological characteristics between MiC and MaC SCN patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHyperplasia of Fat-Containing Cells With Mature Adipocyte Marker Is Associated With Pancreatic Fat Enlargement. \r\nOf al fat-containing cells, 10.4% were intralobular cells, and the diameter of intralobular cells showed a tendency for positive correlation with age. The characteristics of fat-containing cells in the pancreas indicate that some of them may be mature adipocytes, and fat volume may be increased by hyperplasia of fat-containing cells associated with insulin resistance.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHypophosphatemia as a Predictor of Pancreatic Necrosis in Acute Alcohol Induced Pancreatitis. \r\nThe median duration of hospital stay (P-value: 0.65) and rate of intensive care unit (ICU) admission (P-value: 0.41) were similar in both groups. Early hypophosphatemia during admission for AAP was associated with increased risk of developing pancreatic necrosis, however it may not affect overall length of hospital stay or rate of ICU admission.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIntratumoral Injection of Cytotoxic Drugs Plus Hapten Elicits Significant Immune Responses in Sentinel Lymph Nodes: Implications for Cancer Immunotherapy. \r\nThe observed upregulation of angiogenic factors, EMT pathways, and CAF signaling highlighted a complex interaction between tumor and immune responses. These findings provided new insights into the abscopal effect, revealing how targeted therapies can modulate lymph node microenvironments to enhance local immune responses and potentially improve systemic antitumor efficacy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLong-term Outcomes of Surgical Treatment for Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Neoplasm With Synchronous Hepatic Metastasis: A Multicenter Retrospective Cohort Study. \r\nIn this study, the survival benefit of surgery was observed only in the bt-pNET-sHM subgroup. Considering the multifactorial nature of decision-making, surgical intervention for pNEN-sHM management should be approached with a careful and comprehensive assessment, to prevent excessive surgery strategies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatic Cancer Risk and Screening Outcomes in Li-Fraumeni Syndrome.\r\nPC may occur earlier in LFS compared to the general population. WBMRI identifies pancreatic abnormalities less frequently than other pancreatic cancer screening modalities in LFS. If dedicated PC screening is performed in LFS, screening should likely start prior to age 50 and use either EUS or MRI Abd.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSomatic Genomic Profiling of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinomas From a Diverse Cohort of Patients. \r\nLarger studies are needed to further understand molecular characterizations across continental subpopulations. This study provides further rationale for equitable representation of diverse patients in genomic databases and clinical trials.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Significant Impact of Fibrinogen-C-Reactive Protein-Albumin Ratio on the Long-Term Outcomes After Pancreatic Resection for Pancreatic Cancer. \r\nMoreover, factors such as age (P = 0.02), high serum carcinoembryonic antigen level (P < 0.01), preoperative biliary drainage (P = 0.02), preoperative chemotherapy (P = 0.04), lymph node metastasis (P < 0.01), adjuvant chemotherapy (P = 0.046), and high F-CAR (hazards ratio, 1.55;  95% confidence interval, 1.03-2.35;  P = 0.04) were found to be independent and significant predictors of overall survival.

Both the quantity and source of protein significantly influenced the metabolic profiles of formula-fed infants. However, modifications in protein alone cannot fully resolve the metabolic differences between formula-fed and human milk-fed infants, highlighting the complexity of mimicking the human milk feeding-associated metabolic profile. Clinical trial registration\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImpact of linear growth-improving interventions on childhood overnutrition at 24 months: a randomized controlled trial. \r\nComprehensive interventions from preconception to early childhood improve linear growth but do not result in overweight and/or obesity at 24 mo. With better resultant linear and ponderal growth, they converge with the World Health Organization's \"double-duty actions for nutrition\" for LMIC settings, where childhood overweight and/or obesity is a growing concern.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    A Role for Leucine-Rich α2-Glycoprotein in Leukocyte Trafficking and Mucosal Inflammation in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\nOur data suggest that LRG accelerates the progression of colonic inflammation at least in part by enhancing leukocyte trafficking through the upregulation of TGF-β1-induced endoglin expression in vascular endothelial cells.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMK2 Inhibition in CD4+ T Cells Protects Against IFNγ and IL-17A, Chronic Inflammation, and Fibrosis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Models.\r\nThe MK2 pathway regulates inflammatory CD4+ T cells and fibrosis in IBD models and is a potential therapeutic target.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMitochondrial Dysfunction: Unraveling the Elusive Biology Behind Anti-TNF Response During Ulcerative Colitis.\r\nOur results highlight the involvement of metabolic pathways and mitochondrial homeostasis in determining treatment response and their ability to provide promising classification signals with detection levels in both the colon and the bloodstream.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nWinnie Mice: A Chronic and Progressive Model of Ulcerative Colitis.\r\nWhile Winnie mice are currently less studied compared to other more established models of colitis, much has been discovered in the initial years of its use as a UC-like model. In summary, the use of Winnie mice adds to the growing armamentarium that is required to develop precision-based medicine for its future application in treating complex multifactorial diseases, such as UC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    A transcriptomic score to classify the inflammation-dysplasia-cancer sequence lesions in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\n We identified a tissue-based transcriptomic score to classify IDC lesions in IBD patients and uncovered some of the pivotal genes in the carcinogenesis related to inflammation in IBD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAdverse maternal outcomes after vaginal versus caesarean delivery in women with Crohn's disease and prior perianal surgery: A population-based study. \r\nWomen who delivered vaginally versus by c-section had less new perianal surgery (aOR 0.47, 95% CI 0.24-0.93) and no significant differences in intestinal CD surgery (aOR 0.87, 95% CI 0.43-1.75), hospital diagnosed infection (aOR 0.50, 95% CI 0.18-1.38), outpatient antibiotic prescription (aOR 0.92, 95% CI 0.65-1.28) or major hemorrhage (aOR 0.79, 95% CI 0.39-1.59). Vaginal delivery was not associated with increased important adverse maternal outcomes in mothers with CD and prior perianal surgery.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPrevalence, incidence and mortality of inflammatory bowel disease in the Netherlands: development and external validation of machine learning models.\r\n IBD cases can be accurately identified using administrative data.

A correlation between IL-6 concentration and graft failure was found. The role and the significate of inflammatory markers in MP perfusate and their potential to assess graft viability and the risk of post-LT complications has to be further addressed.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreas\r\n    Analysis of the Application of Laparoscopic Peritoneal Lavage and Drainage in the Early Treatment of Severe Acute Pancreatitis. \r\nIn patients with SAP complicated by ascites, early-stage LPLD can effectively alleviate systemic inflammatory response, expedite organ failure reversal, delay disease progression, avoid step-up treatment, reduce postoperative complications and shorten hospitalization duration. This minimally invasive therapeutic approach represents a promising strategy for early intervention in SAP.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFrom Acute Pancreatitis to Diabetes: Risk Factors and Timeline Analysis in a Pediatric Population Study. \r\nChildren face DM risks during or after AP episodes.
