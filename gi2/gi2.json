Registered on PROSPERO: CRD42020197748.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Patient Reported Outcome Measures in Ileoanal Pouch Surgery: a Systematic Review. \r\nThere is lack of standardisation for use of PROMs in IPAA. Complexity of UC and of outcomes after IPAA demands a change in clinical practice and follow up given how crucial PROMs are, compared to their non-routinary use.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Association of linear growth velocities between 0 and 6 years with kidney function and size at 10 years: a birth cohort study in Ethiopia. \r\nWe found a positive association between linear growth velocities at al intervals between 0-6 years and kidney volume. Greater growth between 0-6 years of development was positively associated with kidney size and greater growth velocity after 2 years was associated with higher serum cystatin C level.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCross-sectional measurement of adherence to a proposed sustainable and healthy dietary pattern among U.S. adults using the newly developed Planetary Health Diet Index for the United States.\r\nThe PHDI-US is a new tool that can assess adherence to the Planetary Health Diet and identify key aspects of U.S. adults' diets that could be altered to potentially help improve dietary sustainability and quality.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLipid-based nutrient supplements for prevention of child undernutrition: when less may be more.\r\nThe current evidence suggests that MQ-LNS offers no added benefits over SQ-LNS, although further studies directly comparing MQ-LNS to SQ-LNS would be useful. One possible explanation is incomplete consumption of the MQ-LNS ration and thus lower than desirable intake of certain nutrients. Registry PROSPERO CRD42022382448  REGISTRY AND REGISTRY NUMBER FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS OR META-ANALYSES  Registered with PROSPERO as CRD42022382448 on December 18, 2022 \r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLow-Fat Diet Redux at W.H.O.\r\nMoreover, substitution of carbohydrates for unsaturated fat can increase insulin resistence and cardiometabolic disease, especially among populations with highly prevalent insulin resistance. In this context, the recent World Health Organization conditional recommendation to carry forward the guidance to limit dietary fat to <30% seems ill-advised and should be reconsidered.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOmega-6 fatty acid biomarkers and incident atrial fibrillation: an individual participant-level pooled analysis of 11 international prospective studies. \r\nBiomarkers of n-6 fatty acids including LA and AA were not associated with incident AF. These findings suggest that overall effects of n-6 PUFAs on influencing AF development are neutral.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Brain-Gut Axis: Invasive and Noninvasive Vagus Nerve Stimulation, Limitations, and Potential Therapeutic Approaches.\r\nConsidering the importance of VN function in the brain-gut axis, VNS is a promising treatment option for IBD. This review discusses the potential therapeutic advantages and drawbacks of VNS, particularly the use of noninvasive transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nChildhood Socioeconomic Characteristics and Risk of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Scandinavian Birth Cohort Study.\r\nIn this prospective Scandinavian cohort study, low maternal educational level was, independent of other SES and covariates, significantly associated with later IBD in her child. Further research is needed to elucidate factors that may mediate this relationship.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopically Active Ulcerative Colitis Is Associated With Asymptomatic Atherosclerotic Vascular Disease: A Case-Control Study.\r\nPatients with UC with active mucosal inflammation showed a significantly increased odds of asymptomatic femoral or carotid vascular disease when compared with control individuals.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology Clinic Follow-Up Reduces Gastroenterology-Specific Readmissions Among Patients With Severe Ulcerative Colitis.\r\nOutpatient GI follow-up after UC hospitalization reduces readmissions, with the greatest reduction occurring among patients followed up within 1 week of discharge.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOutcome of Very Early Onset Inflammatory Bowel Disease Associated With Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis: A Multicenter Study From the Pediatric IBD Porto Group of ESPGHAN.\r\nPrimary sclerosing cholangitis related to inflammatory bowel disease has similar baseline characteristics whether diagnosed as VEO-IBD or thereafter. A milder disease course in terms of biliary complications characterizes VEO-PSC-IBD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPlant-based Diets for Inflammatory Bowel Disease: What Is the Evidence?\r\nAlthough initial findings appear promising, it remains unclear whether plant-based diets are an effective adjunct or sole therapy for managing inflammatory bowel disease. Future investigators should aim to conduct methodologically rigorous interventional trials with appropriate control data and consistent and meaningful outcome reporting.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe TNFARE Model of Crohn's Disease-like Ileitis.\r\nUsing germ-free mice, we studied the impact of different diets on the expansion of disease-relevant pathobionts and on the severity of inflammation. In this review article, we review some of the currently available ileitis mouse models and discuss in detail the TNFARE model of CD-like Ileitis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nVascular Disease Is Associated With Differences in Brain Structure and Lower Cognitive Functioning in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Cross-Sectional Study.\r\nVascular comorbidity is associated with deleterious effects on brain structure and lower cognitive functioning in IBD. These findings suggest that proper identification and treatment of vascular disease is essential to the overall management of IBD, and that certain brain areas may serve as critical targets for predicting the response to therapeutic interventions.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    HLA signatures as pathophysiological discriminants of microscopic colitis subtypes.\r\n Our results suggest CC and LC have distinct pathophysiological underpinnings, characterised by an HLA predisposing role only in CC. This challenges existing classifications, eventually calling for a re-evaluation of the utility of MC umbrella definitions.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNLRP3 inhibition leads to impaired mucosal fibroblast function in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.\r\nMoreover, NLRP3 inhibition in intestinal fibroblasts induced autophagy, a cellular process involved in collagen degradation. In the presented study, we demonstrate that inhibiting NLRP3 might pave the way for novel therapeutic approaches in IBD, especially to prevent the severe complication of intestinal fibrosis formation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNeuroimmune modulation through vagus nerve stimulation reduces inflammatory activity in Crohn's disease patients: a prospective open label study.\r\nNeuroimmune modulation via vagus nerve stimulation was generally safe and well-tolerated with a clinically meaningful reduction in clinical disease activity associated with endoscopic improvement, reduced levels of faecal calprotectin and serum cytokines, and improved quality-of-life.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPlasminogen activator inhibitor 1 is a novel faecal biomarker for monitoring disease activity and therapeutic response in inflammatory bowel diseases.\r\nThe serum, mucosal, and faecal PAI-1 concentration correlates with the disease activity and therapeutic response in IBD, suggesting that PAI-1 could be utilized as a novel non-invasive, disease-specific faecal biomarker in the patient follow-up.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    Outcomes of re-referrals of patients with alcohol-related liver disease who were previously declined for liver transplantation.\r\n Patients with ALD previously declined for liver transplant can be re-referred and successfully accepted for transplantation by fulfilling the recommendations made by the multidisciplinary team. Important factors including ongoing abstinence, engagement in addiction treatment and social support are key for successful acceptance.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreas\r\n    Circulating Tumor DNA Is an Accurate Diagnostic Tool and Strong Prognostic Marker in Pancreatic Cancer.\r\n Our study shows that ctDNA is an accurate diagnostic tool and strong prognostic marker in patients with pancreatic cancer. The continued investigation of ctDNA will enable its implementation in clinical practice to optimize the care and survival outcomes of patients with pancreatic cancer.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nE3 Ubiquitin Ligase MARCH8 Promotes Pancreatic Cancer Growth and Metastasis by Activating STAT3 via Degradation of PTPN4.\r\nMARCH8 promoted pancreatic cancer growth and invasion through mediating the degradation of PTPN4 and activated the phosphorylation of STAT3.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Hospital Frailty Risk Score Predicts Poor Prognoses in Middle-Aged and Older Patients With Acute Pancreatitis: A Nationwide Retrospective Cohort Study in Japan.\r\nOur findings highlight the importance of rapid and automated frailty risk assessment using the Hospital Frailty Risk Score for the early identification of high-risk acute pancreatitis patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    European' health care indicators and pancreatic cancer incidence and mortality: A mediation analysis of Eurostat data and Global Burden of Disease Study 2019.\r\nHealth care environment correlates with reported incidence and mortality of pancreatic cancer. This highlights both that ameliorated socio-economic societies suffer from higher incidence but lower mortality, as well as the epidemiological bias originating from countries' diagnostic ability.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOpioid burden in patients with inoperable pancreatic adenocarcinoma and the development of a multivariable risk prediction model for opioid use: A retrospective cohort study.\r\nOpioid use is prevalent in patients with pancreatic cancer, associated with poor prognosis, and can be predicted based on clinical and radiological variables. External validation of this predictive model is required.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPredicting pancreatic fistula after central pancreatectomy using current fistula risk scores for pancreaticoduodenectomy and distal pancreatectomy.\r\n The derived C-FRS models show potential for accurately predicting the development of CR-POPF after CP. However, further validation studies are required to determine the most effective model. In the meantime, the Preop-D-Roberts-FRS is recommended for clinical practice due to its ease of use and preoperative predictability.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the publisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Inflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Cannabis Use: A Marker of Clinical Severity in Inflammatory Bowel Disease?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Nurturing the Gut, Moms with IBD and Their Babies.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous\r\nmisc publications eg case reports, tools of the trade, images of the month, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Inflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    In Acute Severe Ulcerative Colitis Patients Who Receive Rescue Therapy, Prior Maintenance Therapy and Day 3 C-Reactive Protein After Rescue Therapy Are Associated With 12-Month Colectomy Risk.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Targeting the Vagus Nerve to Treat Inflammatory Bowel Disease?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    Access and outcomes in liver transplant candidates: How and when we measure is as important as what we measure.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLetter to the editor: The \"one liver, one artery\" approach for marginal grafts.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver transplantation from uncontrolled DCD donors-is there light at the end of the tunnel?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiving donor liver transplantation in the U.S. for alcohol-associated liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: An evaluation in the current era.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPediatric sarcopenia: An imperfect science in evolution.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPlasma exchange, a promising liver support system with still relevant uncertainties.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPredicting cardiovascular events post-liver transplant: Is CT coronary angiography the noninvasive test we have been looking for?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSarcopenic obesity: A new predictor of recipient liver regeneration after living donor liver transplantation?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSecond Thoughts about Second Opinions for Liver Transplantation.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreas\r\n    Post-Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography Pancreatitis: Prevention Is Better Than Cure.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSeeing the Forest Through the Trees of Underscreened, Underdiagnosed, and Undertreated EPI.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetters&Replies\r\nLetters to the editors and authors’ replies\r\n\r\n\r\n    Inflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Reply: \"Cannabis Use: A Marker of Clinical Severity in Inflammatory Bowel Disease?\"\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Existing and emerging factors should be integrated within predictive and prognostic models to help improve clinical outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPredictors of Hospital-related Outcomes of COVID-19 Infection in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease in the Early Pandemic Phase: A Nationwide Inpatient Database Survey.\r\nPatients with IBD and COVID-19 have worse outcomes, with a higher incidence of severe COVID-19 disease, leading to higher mortality rates, longer lengths of stay, and increased total hospitalization costs. Encouraging preventive health measures and treating promptly with advanced COVID-19 therapies may improve outcomes and decrease the healthcare burden.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Validation of the IBD-Control Questionnaire across different sociodemographic and clinical subgroups: Secondary analysis of a nationwide electronic survey.\r\nIBD-Control-8 is a psychometrically robust scale which can be used across a range of populations. It offers a quick, reliable and valid method of assessing patient-perceived control. The construct of \"control\" includes traditional HRQoL and a novel domain relating to treatment perception.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    Liver ischemia-reperfusion injury: From trigger loading to shot firing.\r\nIt is possible to compare this process to a shooting gun, where the loading trigger is the ischemia period and the firing shot is the reperfusion phase. In this optic, this article aims at reviewing the main ischemic events following the phases of the surgical timeline, considering the consequent reperfusion damage.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRole of protein induced by vitamin-K Absence-II in transplanted patients with hepatocellular cancer not producing alpha-fetoprotein.\r\nPIVKA-II secretion is a relevant risk factor for post-LT HCC recurrence. The role of this marker is independent of the AFP status. Combining both tumor markers, especially in the setting of LT, should be of great relevance for adding information about predicting the post-LT risk of tumor recurrence and selecting these patients for transplantation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreas\r\n    Lactated Ringer's or Normal Saline for Initial Resuscitation in Patients Hospitalized With Acute Pancreatitis: A Retrospective Database Analysis.\r\nIn this study, we demonstrate an association between use of LR as initial resuscitation fluid and reduced 1-year mortality in a large retrospective sample of veterans hospitalized with AP. These results support the use of LR for resuscitation for most patients hospitalized with AP.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatic Acinar Cystic Transformation: Familial Forms Do Exist.\r\nFurther research, with high throughput sequencing technologies, may elucidate genetic polymorphisms explaining potential ACT familial phenotype.

Thus, intervention strategies to improve dietary sustainability need to be tailored differently to females and males. Diet quality should also be considered when promoting reduced GHGE diets.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Characterization of the Gut Microbiota and Mycobiota in Italian Pediatric Patients With Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis and Ulcerative Colitis.\r\nWe describe the gut microbiota and mycobiota dysbiosis associated to PSC-UC disease. Our results evidenced a gut imbalance, with the reduction of gut commensal microorganisms with stated anti-inflammatory properties (ie, Akkermansia, Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, Oscillospira, Meyerozyma, and Malassezia) and the increase of pathobionts (ie, Streptococcus, Saccharomyces, and Debaryomyces) that could be involved in PSC progression. Altogether, these events may concur in the pathophysiology of PSC in the framework of UC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nExpression of Circulating let-7e and miR-126 May Predict Clinical Remission in Patients With Crohn's Disease Treated With Anti-TNF-a Biologics.\r\n These results provide evidence that expression levels of circulating let-7e and miR-126 at baseline may predict clinical remission in CD patients treated with anti-TNF-a biologics.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRacial and Ethnic Disparities in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: An Online Survey.\r\nBIPOC/H patients with IBD had worse clinical disease, lower HRQOL scores, had more medication concerns, had less access to specialists, had less social and emotional support, and used emergency department services more often than W/NH patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Mitigating the risk of Tofacitinib-induced adverse events in the elderly population with Ulcerative Colitis.\r\nModulation of induction dose and anti-thrombotic therapy may have contributed to prevent cardiologic events and thromboembolism. The introduction of zoster vaccine virtually eliminated zoster risk after the first cases. Potential malignancies deserve a careful work-up of older patients before treatment start.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nProspective Observational Evaluation of the Time-Dependency of Adalimumab Immunogenicity and Drug Concentration in Ulcerative Colitis Patients: the POETIC II Study.\r\nLoss of response to adalimumab therapy was significantly more common in the Ulcerative Colitis compared to the Crohn's disease cohort and was driven by a higher rate of non-immunogenic, pharmacodynamic parameters.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nValidation of the IBD-Control Questionnaire across different sociodemographic and clinical subgroups: Secondary analysis of a nationwide electronic survey.\r\nIBD-Control-8 is a psychometrically robust scale which can be used across a range of populations.

In terms of changes in BW, BMI, and WC, there is firm evidence for the overall weight-loss effects of GLP-1RAs. Of the GLP-1RAs, semaglutide might be the most effective agent.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nVitamin D supplementation for improving bone density in vitamin D-deficient children and adolescents: systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.\r\nClinically important benefits for bone density from 1-y vitamin D supplementation in healthy children and adolescents, regardless of baseline vitamin D status, are unlikely. However, our findings are mostly generalizable to White postpubertal girls and do not apply to those with baseline 25(OH)D outside the studied range or with symptomatic vitamin D deficiency (e.g., rickets). This study was preregistered at PROSPERO as CRD42017068772.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Defining the Roles of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Clinical Pharmacists in the United States: A Systematic Review and National RAND/UCLA Consensus.\r\nThis consensus defines IBD clinical pharmacists' roles and provides a framework for embedded clinical pharmacists in IBD care.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nUnveiling the Ghrelin and Obestatin Roles in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Assessing Their Pathogenic Implications and Biomarker Utility.\r\nOur results demonstrate that IBD patients with active disease have higher levels of ghrelin, which needs to be confirmed in future studies. Also, the obestatin/ghrelin ratio might be a promising biomarker for the assessment of disease activity.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Clin Nutr\r\n    Associations of Dietary Sugar Types with Coronary Heart Disease Risk: A Prospective Cohort Study.\r\nIntakes of TGE, total sugar, added sugar, and fructose from added sugar and juice were associated with higher CHD risk, but TFE and fructose from fruits and vegetables were not.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDiet-induced Weight Loss and Phenotypic Flexibility Among Healthy Overweight Adults: A Randomized Trial.\r\n Application of dietary challenges increased sensitivity to detect metabolic response to weight loss intervention. Large interindividual variation was observed across a wide range of measurements allowing the identification of distinct responses to the weight loss intervention and mechanistic insight into the metabolic response to weight loss.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGlutamate infusion reduces myocardial dysfunction after coronary artery bypass grafting according to NT-proBNP: summary of two randomized controlled trials (GLUTAMICS I-II).\r\nInfusion of glutamate reduced postoperative rise in NT-proBNP after CABG in medium to high-risk patients. A significantly blunted effect was observed only in insulin-treated diabetes patients. Clinical trial registration\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIntraduodenal nutrient infusion differentially alters intestinal nutrient sensing, appetite, and satiety responses in lean and obese subjects.\r\n Nutrient-induced gut hormone release and response to transient vagal blockade are significantly blunted in subjects with obesity.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInulin-type fructans and 2'fucosyllactose alter both microbial composition and appear to alleviate stress-induced mood state in a working population compared to placebo (maltodextrin): the EFFICAD Trial, a randomized, controlled trial.\r\n The results of this study indicate that oligofructose and combination of oligofructose/2'fucosyllactose, can beneficially alter microbial composition along with improving mood state parameters. Future work is needed to understand key microbial differences separating individual responses to 2'fucosyllactose supplementation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPericonceptional intakes of methyl donors and other micronutrients involved in one-carbon metabolism may further reduce the risk of neural tube defects in offspring: a United States population-based case-control study of women meeting the folic acid recommendations.\r\nOur findings support that NTD prevention, in the context of folic acid fortification, could be augmented with intakes of methyl donors and other micronutrients involved in folate metabolism.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nUntargeted Metabolomic Analysis Investigating Links Between Unprocessed Red Meat Intake and Markers of Inflammation.\r\nOur analyses were unable to support a relationship between either processed or unprocessed red meat and inflammation, over and above any confounding by BMI. Glutamine, a plasma correlate of lower unprocessed red meat intake, was associated with lower CRP levels. The differences in diet-inflammation associations vs diet metabolite-inflammation associations warrants further investigation to understand the extent that these arise from (1) a reduction in measurement error with metabolite measures;  (2) the extent that factors other than unprocessed red meat intake contribute to glutamine levels;  (3) the ability of plasma metabolites to capture individual differences in how food intake is metabolized.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflamm Bowel Dis\r\n    Gut Microbiota Composition in Long-Remission Ulcerative Colitis is Close to a Healthy Gut Microbiota.\r\nRecovery may just reflect adequate control of inflammatory activity, but higher bacterial diversity or the presence of A. muciniphila in fecal samples predicts flare-free outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nManagement of Perianal Fistulizing Crohn's Disease.\r\nIn this review, we provide an up-to-date overview of the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and medical management of perianal fistulizing CD. A brief overview of the surgical management of perianal fistulizing CD is also provided.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMicrobial and Metabolite Signatures of Stress Reactivity in Ulcerative Colitis Patients in Clinical Remission Predict Clinical Flare Risk.\r\nHigh SR in UC is characterized by microbial signatures that predict clinical flare risk, suggesting that the microbiome may contribute to stress-induced UC flares.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMultidisciplinary Inflammatory Bowel Disease Conference: The Impact of the Expert Pathologist on Patient Care.\r\n The majority of diagnostic changes made at the multidisciplinary IBD conference were due to histopathologic re-interpretation. A change in diagnosis at times led to significant modifications in medical or surgical management. An expert gastrointestinal pathologist is an essential MDT member for IBD management.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRelationship Between Rectal Swab and Tissue Samples in Mucosa-associated Microbiota in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\nSwab microbiota more closely resembled tissue microbiota relative to fecal microbiota, but there were still differences. Bowel preparation did not alter the overall swab microbiota in the short term but markedly changed the microbial composition in most patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Effectiveness and Safety of First-Line Thioguanine in Thiopurine-Naïve Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients.\r\nAt 12 months, first-line thioguanine therapy was clinically effective in 53% of thiopurine-naïve inflammatory bowel disease patients with an acceptable safety profile.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Crohns Colitis\r\n    Efficacy and safety of approximately 3 years of continuous ozanimod in moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis: interim analysis of the True North open-label extension.\r\nAmong patients who achieved clinical response after 1 year of ozanimod treatment during True North, a high percentage sustained clinical and mucosal efficacy over 2 additional years in the OLE. No new safety signals were observed with long-term ozanimod use.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease continues to increase in the Faroe Islands - a cohort study from 1960-2020.\r\nThe incidence of IBD continues to increase in the Faroe Islands, mainly driven by UC. The incidence presents with an uneven geographical distribution, which suggests an adverse interaction between unknown environmental factors and genetic traits. The prevalence in 2021 corresponded to 1.3% of the Faroese population suffering from IBD. Environmental risk factors are suspected to impact this homogenous high-risk population;  however, the reason is unclear.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTofacitinib versus oral prednisolone for induction of remission in moderately active ulcerative colitis (ORCHID): A prospective, open-label, randomized, pilot study.\r\n In patients with moderately active ulcerative colitis, there was no difference in the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib and oral prednisolone for induction of remission at 8 weeks.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transpl\r\n    A model Including standardized weight improved predicting waiting list mortality in adolescent liver transplant candidates: A US national study.\r\n MELD-TEEN could improve the accuracy of allocation of liver transplant among adolescents by incorporating weight z-score compared to MELD 3.0 and PELD-Na-Cr.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatology\r\n    Development and external validation of a nomogram for prediction of post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis.\r\nWe successfully developed a good predictive model for PEP.
