Clinicians and patients should focus on options with the most reliable evidence and take adverse event profiles and patient preferences into consideration.

Primary funding source None.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHigh- Versus Low-Dose Exercise Therapy for Knee Osteoarthritis : A Randomized Controlled Multicenter Trial.\r\n The results do not support the superiority of high-dose exercise over low-dose exercise for most outcomes. However, small benefits with high-dose exercise were found for knee function in sports and recreation and for QoL. Primary funding source Swedish Rheumatic Fund.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHydroxychloroquine Dose and Risk for Incident Retinopathy : A Cohort Study.\r\n In this large, contemporary cohort with active surveillance retinopathy screening, the overall risk for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy was 8.6% after 15 years, and most cases were mild. Higher hydroxychloroquine dose was associated with progressively greater risk for incident retinopathy. Primary funding source National Institutes of Health.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLancet\r\n    2 days versus 5 days of postoperative antibiotics for complex appendicitis: a pragmatic, open-label, multicentre, non-inferiority randomised trial.\r\nAdopting this strategy will reduce adverse effects of antibiotics and length of hospital stay.

Funding The National Cancer Center Research and the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare of Japan.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPerformance of cardiovascular disease risk prediction equations in more than 14 000 survivors of cancer in New Zealand primary care: a validation study.\r\nOur findings suggest that the equations are reasonable clinical tools for use in survivors of cancer in New Zealand.

Funding None.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nN Engl J Med\r\n    Aspirin or Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin for Thromboprophylaxis after a Fracture.\r\nIn patients with extremity fractures that had been treated operatively or with any pelvic or acetabular fracture, thromboprophylaxis with aspirin was noninferior to low-molecular-weight heparin in preventing death and was associated with low incidences of deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and low 90-day mortality. (Funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute;  PREVENT CLOT ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02984384.).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nBivalent Omicron BA.1-Adapted BNT162b2 Booster in Adults Older than 55 Years.\r\nThe candidate monovalent or bivalent omicron BA.1-adapted vaccines had a safety profile similar to that of BNT162b2 (30 µg), induced substantial neutralizing responses against ancestral and omicron BA.1 strains, and, to a lesser extent, neutralized BA.4, BA.5, and BA.2.75 strains. (Funded by BioNTech and Pfizer;  ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04955626.).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEarly Restrictive or Liberal Fluid Management for Sepsis-Induced Hypotension.\r\nAmong patients with sepsis-induced hypotension, the restrictive fluid strategy that was used in this trial did not result in significantly lower (or higher) mortality before discharge home by day 90 than the liberal fluid strategy.

For other comparisons, the evidence was entirely missing or insufficient to draw conclusions. Primary funding source American College of Physicians.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nValues and Preferences of Patients With Depressive Disorders Regarding Pharmacologic and Nonpharmacologic Treatments : A Rapid Review.\r\n Low-certainty evidence suggests that there may be some differences in preferences for talk therapy or pharmacologic treatment of depressive disorders based on gender or race/ethnicity. In addition, low-certainty evidence suggests that insomnia, anxiety, fatigue, weight gain, agitation, and sexual dysfunction may be the most important nonserious adverse events for patients treated with antidepressants. Evidence is lacking or insufficient to draw any further conclusions about patients' weighing or valuation of the benefits and harms of depression treatments.

Increased attention should then be given to understanding existing resource allocation and distribution patterns, establish more egalitarian networks that encompass the breadth of One Health issues, and serve communities most affected by emerging, re-emerging, or endemic threats at the human-animal-environment interface.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAdvancing One human-animal-environment Health for global health security: what does the evidence say?\r\nOne Health approaches appear to be most effective and sustainable in the prevention, preparedness, and early detection and investigation of evolving risks and hazards;  the evidence base for their application is strongest in the control of endemic and neglected tropical diseases. For benefits to be maximised and extended, improved One Health operationalisation is needed by strengthening multisectoral coordination mechanisms at national, regional, and global levels.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGlobal and regional governance of One Health and implications for global health security.\r\nSubstantial efforts should be made to address the social-ecological drivers of health emergencies including outbreaks of emerging, re-emerging, and endemic infectious diseases. These drivers include climate change, biodiversity loss, and land-use change, and therefore require effective and enforceable legislation, investment, capacity building, and integration of other sectors and professionals beyond health.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHow prepared is the world? Identifying weaknesses in existing assessment frameworks for global health security through a One Health approach.\r\nA complex and interdependent set of challenges threaten human, animal, and ecosystem health, and we cannot afford to overlook important contextual factors, or the determinants of these shared threats. Health security assessment frameworks should therefore ensure that the process undertaken to prioritise and build capacity adheres to core One Health principles and that interventions and outcomes are assessed in terms of added value, trade-offs, and cobenefits across human, animal, and environmental health systems.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOffline: Rethinking the world.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOne Health: a call for ecological equity.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nN Engl J Med\r\n    Audio Interview: Weighing the Protective Value of Covid-19 Infection.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGrowing Evidence and Remaining Questions in Adolescent Transgender Care.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPeriprosthetic Joint Infection.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThromboprophylaxis after Extremity Fracture - Time for Aspirin?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous\r\nmisc publications eg case reports, tools of the trade, images of the month, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ann Intern Med\r\n    Annals for Educators - January 2023.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAnnals for Hospitalists - January 2023.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAnnals Graphic Medicine - Dr. Mom: Assorted Clinical Pearls From 2022.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAssociation of Sugar-Sweetened, Artificially Sweetened, and Unsweetened Coffee Consumption With All-Cause and Cause-Specific Mortality.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAssociation of Sugar-Sweetened, Artificially Sweetened, and Unsweetened Coffee Consumption With All-Cause and Cause-Specific Mortality.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFirearm Injury: An Escalating Health Crisis.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGrief's Terrain.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOf Pandemics and Renewals.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPain, Analgesic Use, and Patient Satisfaction With Spinal Versus General Anesthesia for Hip Fracture Surgery.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPain, Analgesic Use, and Patient Satisfaction With Spinal Versus General Anesthesia for Hip Fracture Surgery.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPain, Analgesic Use, and Patient Satisfaction With Spinal Versus General Anesthesia for Hip Fracture Surgery.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSecond Identified Human Infection With the Avian Influenza Virus H10N3: A Case Report.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSummary for Patients: High-Dose Versus Low-Dose Exercise Therapy for Knee Osteoarthritis.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSummary for Patients: Hydroxychloroquine Dose and Risk for Incident Retinopathy.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSummary for Patients: Nonpharmacologic and Pharmacologic Treatments of Adults in the Acute Phase of Major Depression.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nWeb Exclusive.
