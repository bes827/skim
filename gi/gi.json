These results support the benefits of STRIDE for participants with uHCC globally, including the Asia-Pacific region. Clinical trial number NCT03298451 IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS  The global, phase III HIMALAYA study found that the STRIDE (Single Tremelimumab Regular Interval Durvalumab) regimen improved overall survival (OS), including long-term OS, vs sorafenib, and that durvalumab monotherapy was noninferior to sorafenib in participants with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC). However, there are differences in the aetiology and clinical practices related to HCC in parts of Asia, compared to Western countries and Japan, which could lead to differences in treatment outcomes between these regions. The results of this analysis demonstrate the benefits of STRIDE for participants in the Asia-Pacific region, consistent with the full, global study population. Overall, these findings continue to support the use of STRIDE in a diverse population, reflective of uHCC globally.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPegIFN alpha-2a reduces relapse in HBeAg-negative patients after nucleo(s)tide analogue cessation: A randomized-controlled trial.\r\nSwitching from NUC to PegIFN-α-2a treatment for 48 weeks significantly reduces virological relapse rates and achieves higher HBsAg loss rates than NUC treatment cessation alone in HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B patients. Impact and implications Nucleo(s)tide analogue (NUC) cessation can lead to HBsAg clearance but also a high rate of virological relapse, but an optimised scheme to reduce the virological relapse rate after NUC withdrawal is yet to be reported. This randomized controlled trial investigated the effect of switching from NUC to PegIFN-α-2a treatment for 48 weeks on virological relapse until week 96 in HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B patients. The interferon monotherapy group had a significantly lower cumulative virological relapse rate (20.8% vs 53.6%, P < 0.0001) and higher HBsAg loss rate (21.5% vs 9.0%, P= 0.03) than the NUC cessation group until week 96. This provides an optimized strategy for NUC cessation in HBeAg-negative patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTransposon-based oncogene integration in Abcb4(Mdr2)-/- mice recapitulates high susceptibility to cholangiocarcinoma in primary sclerosing cholangitis.\r\nMdr2-/-, which features reliable tumor induction in PSC-like background of biliary injury and fibrosis.

Data regarding tolerance and safety are reassuring. These findings challenge preconceived ideas on methotrexate and suggest that it is a valid first-line conventional option for the treatment of mild-to-moderate Crohn's disease.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAm J Gastroenterol\r\n    Using Diet to Treat Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review.\r\n Currently, there is limited evidence to support the use of specific diets to treat adult patients with mildly to moderately active IBD. Larger, randomized studies with standardized methodologies and outcome measures, rigorous adherence assessment, and an emphasis on endoscopic assessment outcome measures are required to validate most diets that have been studied for IBD. The included sample diet plans and dietary recommendations may prove helpful in the interim as part of a holistic strategy to manage patients with IBD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    RISK OF DE NOVO BARRETT'S ESOPHAGUS POST SLEEVE GASTRECTOMY: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF STUDIES WITH LONG TERM FOLLOW UP.\r\n Our analysis shows that SG results in a significantly increased risk of de novo BE and higher rates of EE, PPI use and HH. Our findings suggest that clinicians should routinely screen patients with SG for BE and future surveillance intervals should be followed as per societal guidelines.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Efficacy and safety of risankizumab by baseline corticosteroid use and achievement of corticosteroid-free clinical and endoscopic outcomes in patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease.\r\nEfficacy of risankizumab 600 mg induction therapy was independent of concomitant corticosteroid use. Risankizumab 180 and 360 mg maintenance therapy yielded high rates of corticosteroid-free clinical and endoscopic outcomes at week 52.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLong-term safety and efficacy of filgotinib for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis: Interim analysis from up to 4 years of follow-up in the SELECTION open-label long-term extension study. \r\nSafety results showed a proven long-term benefit-risk profile. FIL200-treated CDC achievers had better long-term outcomes than non-achievers.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPrevalence and prognostic value of zinc and selenium deficiency in advanced chronic liver disease.\r\n Zinc and selenium deficiencies are common in ACLD patients especially with higher MELD and HVPG. Low zinc and selenium levels independently predicted hepatic decompensation and liver-related death. The effect of zinc/selenium supplementation in ACLD should be investigated in future trials.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe effect of dietary emulsifiers and thickeners on intestinal barrier function and its response to acute stress in healthy adult humans: A randomised controlled feeding study.\r\n High intake of emulsifiers improved barrier function in the unstressed state, but increased intestinal permeability to stress, without evidence of inflammation. A LED was protective of the stress effect.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAm J Gastroenterol\r\n    Antigliadin antibodies and the brain in people without celiac disease: a case-control study.\r\nOur analysis is the most comprehensive to date and utilises a number of outcome measures known to be sensitive to subtle shifts in neurophysiology and cognition. Incidental AGA does not appear to be associated with any indications of neuropsychological deficit.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDeep learning model using stool pictures for predicting endoscopic mucosal inflammation in patients with ulcerative colitis.\r\nDLSUC demonstrated a good discriminating power similar to that of Fcal in predicting endoscopic activity with improved accuracy in patients without rectal sparing. This study implies that stool photos are a useful monitoring tool for typical UC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDelivery of Outpatient Cirrhosis Care Via Tele-visit is Not Associated with Increased Mortality as Compared to Traditional In-Person Visits.\r\n Our findings suggest that outpatient cirrhosis care by tele-visit is associated with outcomes no worse than traditional in-person visits. This should reassure providers who hesitate to provide virtual care to patients with cirrhosis due to concerns for poorer outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInpatient Gastroenterology Consults Have Little Utility Prior to Transesophageal Echocardiograms in a Prospective Cohort Study.\r\n Inpatient GI team workups to clear patients for a TEE found no contraindications to TEEs, did not change patient care plans, and led to increased hospital costs and lengths of stay.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLinear-array Endoscopic Ultrasound and Narrow-Banding Imaging Measure the Invasion Depth of Nonpedunculated Rectal Lesions with Comparable Accuracy based on a Randomized Controlled Trial.\r\nLinear EUS and NBI measure the invasion depth of NPRLs with comparable accuracy. The combination of the two methods does not improve the diagnostic accuracy. Single NBI should be preferred, considering its simplicity and convenience in clinical practice.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPrevalence of Preceding and Follow-up Outpatient Care Surrounding Emergency Department Visits for Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Identifying Opportunities for Quality Improvement.\r\n Gaps in preceding and follow-up care signal opportunities to improve care quality.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRisk of Small Intestine Cancer in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Propensity-Matched Study from a Large Multi-Center Database in the United States.\r\n Both patients with CD and, interestingly, UC had an elevated risk for developing SBC compared to the general population.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSevere Cholestasis Predicts Recurrent Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis Following Liver Transplantation.\r\nThe development of cholestasis within 3 to 12 months following LT was predictive of rPSC and graft loss.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Association Between Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitor or Angiotensin Receptor Blocker Exposure and Key Cirrhosis-Related Outcomes.\r\nACE-I/ARB exposure was associated with reduced mortality, potentially through CV and other (renal, malignancy-related) mechanisms. In patients with compensated disease, ACE-I/ARB was not associated with hepatic decompensation or HCC. Future research should identify subsets of patients who benefit from ACE-I/ARB exposure.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Automated Neutrophil Quantification and Histological Score Estimation in Ulcerative Colitis.\r\n The AI system's precise localization and quantification of neutrophils proved valuable for histological assessment and clinical prognosis stratification.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClinical Presentation and Outcomes of Alpha-Gal Syndrome.\r\n A diagnosis of AGS should be strongly considered in patients with a history of tick bites and clinical presentation of allergic or GI manifestations. Dietary intervention is effective in most but not al patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDefining and Understanding Diagnostic Delays Among Pancreatic Cancer Patients: A Retrospective Cohort Study.\r\nOver one-third of pancreatic cancer patients experienced a diagnostic delay, mostly due to inadequate recognition of red-flag findings. Results can inform targeted interventions to reduce preventable diagnostic delays among pancreatic cancer patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndosc Int Open\r\n    Learning curve for endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) in the United States: Large, untutored, single-operator experience.\r\nFollowing ex-vivo training in an animal model, an untutored expert operator achieved competency in ESD between 250 and 350 procedures. Our data can inform development of future training programs in the West.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nMortality from upper gastrointestinal tumors in colorectal cancer screening patients.\r\n10 mm and HGD. Future studies will demonstrate whether integrated screening with additional gastroscopy is effective in CRC screening participants with large or highly dysplastic polyps.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nValue of green sign and chicken skin aspects for detecting malignancy of colorectal neoplasia in a prospective characterization study.\r\nThe green sign may be associated with malignant colorectal neoplasia. Targeting these areas before precise analysis of the lesion could be a way of improving detection of focal malignancies and prediction of the most severe histology.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nEndoscopy\r\n    Effect of Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation Based on Wrist-Ankle Acupuncture Theory for Pain Relief during Non-Anesthetic Colonoscopy: A Randomized Controlled Trial.\r\n TENS-WAA effectively reduces pain during non-anesthetized colonoscopy, especially in male participants, providing a promising non-invasive analgesic method.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Long-term cost-effectiveness of case-finding and mass-screening for coeliac disease in children. \r\nAn earlier identification of CD through screening or case-finding in children using a POCT leads to improved health outcomes and is cost-effective in the long-term compared to current care. If the feasibility and acceptability of the proposed strategies are successful, implementation in Dutch regular care is needed.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMucosal Single-Cell Profiling of Crohn's-Like Disease of the Pouch Reveals Unique Pathogenesis and Therapeutic Targets. \r\nAdditionally, CDP pouch/ileum exhibited heightened endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress across al major cell compartments. CDP likely represents a distinct entity of inflammatory bowel disease with heightened ER stress in both immune and non-immune cells, which may become a novel diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for CDP.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    A prospective randomized controlled trial of water exchange plus cap versus water exchange colonoscopy in unsedated Veterans.\r\nUnsedated colonoscopy was appropriate for unescorted Veterans. WE alone was sufficient. Adding a cap did not reduce RTMIP. Patient specific factors and application of WE with insertion suction of infused water contributed to high and low RTMIP, respectively. For unesorted patients, selecting those with low anxiety, avoiding low body mass index, history of depression or self-reported poor health and adhering to the steps of WE can minimize RTMIP to ensure success of unsedated colonoscopy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAdenoma detection rate and tolerability of two ultra-low volume bowel preparations in screening: a noninferiority randomized controlled trial.\r\nDespite the superior bowel preparation quality associated with 1L-PEGA, the safety, tolerability and overall satisfaction of participants were higher with SPMC. (EudraCT: 2019-003186-18) on March 18, 2019.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nBOOSTING EFFICIENCY IN THE ENDOSCOPY SUITE: INTEGRATING TEAM WORKFLOWS IMPROVES PRODUCTIVITY AND MINIMIZES COST.\r\nThis study defines variations in TOT and demonstrates that finding imbalances and sharing the workload significantly cuts costs and improves the overall efficiency of the different subgroups in the turnover process.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDistal Cap-assisted Endoscopic Mucosal Resection allows the safe and effective resection of adherent, dysplastic lesions in the setting of inflammatory bowel disease: a multicenter, retrospective study with video.\r\n EMR-DC represents an attractive option for the resection of adherent dysplastic lesions in chronic IBD which is effective, safe, and inexpensive.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLong-term outcomes of endoscopic ultrasonography-guided balloon-occluded gastrojejunostomy bypass for malignant gastric outlet obstruction (with video).\r\nEPASS demonstrates safety and reliability in EUS-GE, offering a viable option for symptomatic malignant GOO treatment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTHE ROLE OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE CHOLANGIOPANCREATOGRAPHY FOR PREVENTING PANCREATIC FLUID COLLECTION RECURRENCE AFTER EUS-GUIDED DRAINAGE OF WALLED-OFF NECROSIS.\r\n Patients with WON who underwent MRCP prior to transmural stent removal had a lower rate of PFC recurrence largely due to the identification of DPD with appropriate endoscopic management.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    Association of breast milk-derived arachidonic acid-induced infant gut dysbiosis with the onset of atopic dermatitis. \r\nMoreover, AA significantly increased IL-4 secretion in HaCaT cells costimulated with TNF-α and INF-γ. This study demonstrates that AA is intimately linked to the onset of AD via gut dysbiosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCirculating tumour DNA in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma across tumour stages and treatments.\r\n ctDNA offers dynamic information reflecting tumour biology. It represents a non-invasive tool useful to guide HCC clinical management.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCombination of carvedilol with variceal band ligation in prevention of first variceal bleed in Child-Turcotte-Pugh B and C cirrhosis with high-risk oesophageal varices: the 'CAVARLY TRIAL'.\r\n In CTP B and C cirrhosis patients with high-risk varices, combination of carvedilol and VBL is more effective than either therapy alone, for primary prevention of variceal bleeding.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImpact of prenatal and postnatal maternal IBD status on offspring's risk of IBD: a population-based cohort study.\r\n Offspring had a greater risk of IBD when either parent was diagnosed before childbirth rather than later, emphasising genetic predisposition and environmental risk factors rather than maternal inflammation in utero as risk factors for IBD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    Exome-wide association analysis identifies novel risk loci for alcohol-associated hepatitis.\r\nThis study has identified two new genes of high effect size with a previously unknown contribution to ALD, and highlights both the overlap in etiology between liver diseases, and the unique origins of AH.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLong-term outcome and risk stratification in compensated advanced chronic liver disease after HCV-cure. \r\nBaveno VII criteria to exclude (FU-liver stiffness measurement 3 y).

This expert commentary incorporates important as well as recently published studies in this field, and it reflects the experiences of the authors who are experts in treating patients with cyclic vomiting syndrome.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeta-analysis\r\nmeta-analyses and systematic reviews\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Meta-analysis: High pooled positive predictive value of the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition no-biopsy approach for coeliac disease testing in children.\r\n Both no-biopsy criteria exhibit high PPV when compared to the reference standard. These results provide a consistent message of accuracy and feasibility to inform change and improve outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAm J Gastroenterol\r\n    Using Diet to Treat Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review.\r\n Currently, there is limited evidence to support the use of specific diets to treat adult patients with mildly to moderately active IBD. Larger, randomized studies with standardized methodologies and outcome measures, rigorous adherence assessment, and an emphasis on endoscopic assessment outcome measures are required to validate most diets that have been studied for IBD. The included sample diet plans and dietary recommendations may prove helpful in the interim as part of a holistic strategy to manage patients with IBD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Disparities for Hispanic Adults with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease in the US: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.\r\n Health disparities for US Hispanic adults continue to worsen with significantly higher relative risk of MASLD and MASH compared to non-Hispanic adults. Public health efforts to optimize screening and care delivery for adult Hispanic population are urgently needed.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    Risk and Pathological Factors of Recurrence after Endoscopic Resection for Superficial Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.\r\n The recurrence rate of superficial ESCC after ER is acceptable. Patients with positive margins, LVI, LI and SM1 need to pay significant attention to the risk of recurrence. LI and VI should be evaluate separately. (PROSPERO CRD42023406309).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    Comparative efficacy of pharmacologic therapies for MASH in reducing liver fat content: Systematic review and network meta-analysis.\r\nThis study provides an updated, relative rank-order efficacy of therapies for MASH in reducing hepatic fat.

Risankizumab 180 and 360 mg maintenance therapy yielded high rates of corticosteroid-free clinical and endoscopic outcomes at week 52.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPrevalence and prognosis of patients with MASLD-related cirrhosis after an ICU hospitalization in France: A single-centre prospective study.\r\n MASLD or MetALD was responsible for ⅓ of the causes of cirrhosis in the ICU. MASLD-related cirrhosis is as severe as ALD-related cirrhosis. Liver transplantation should be rapidly discussed.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAm J Gastroenterol\r\n    Antigliadin antibodies and the brain in people without celiac disease: a case-control study.\r\nOur analysis is the most comprehensive to date and utilises a number of outcome measures known to be sensitive to subtle shifts in neurophysiology and cognition. Incidental AGA does not appear to be associated with any indications of neuropsychological deficit.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDeep learning model using stool pictures for predicting endoscopic mucosal inflammation in patients with ulcerative colitis.\r\nDLSUC demonstrated a good discriminating power similar to that of Fcal in predicting endoscopic activity with improved accuracy in patients without rectal sparing. This study implies that stool photos are a useful monitoring tool for typical UC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDelivery of Outpatient Cirrhosis Care Via Tele-visit is Not Associated with Increased Mortality as Compared to Traditional In-Person Visits.\r\n Our findings suggest that outpatient cirrhosis care by tele-visit is associated with outcomes no worse than traditional in-person visits. This should reassure providers who hesitate to provide virtual care to patients with cirrhosis due to concerns for poorer outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInpatient Gastroenterology Consults Have Little Utility Prior to Transesophageal Echocardiograms in a Prospective Cohort Study.\r\n Inpatient GI team workups to clear patients for a TEE found no contraindications to TEEs, did not change patient care plans, and led to increased hospital costs and lengths of stay.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLinear-array Endoscopic Ultrasound and Narrow-Banding Imaging Measure the Invasion Depth of Nonpedunculated Rectal Lesions with Comparable Accuracy based on a Randomized Controlled Trial.\r\nLinear EUS and NBI measure the invasion depth of NPRLs with comparable accuracy. The combination of the two methods does not improve the diagnostic accuracy. Single NBI should be preferred, considering its simplicity and convenience in clinical practice.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPrevalence of Preceding and Follow-up Outpatient Care Surrounding Emergency Department Visits for Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Identifying Opportunities for Quality Improvement.\r\n Gaps in preceding and follow-up care signal opportunities to improve care quality.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRisk of Small Intestine Cancer in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Propensity-Matched Study from a Large Multi-Center Database in the United States.\r\n Both patients with CD and, interestingly, UC had an elevated risk for developing SBC compared to the general population.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSevere Cholestasis Predicts Recurrent Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis Following Liver Transplantation.\r\nThe development of cholestasis within 3 to 12 months following LT was predictive of rPSC and graft loss.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Association Between Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitor or Angiotensin Receptor Blocker Exposure and Key Cirrhosis-Related Outcomes.\r\nACE-I/ARB exposure was associated with reduced mortality, potentially through CV and other (renal, malignancy-related) mechanisms. In patients with compensated disease, ACE-I/ARB was not associated with hepatic decompensation or HCC. Future research should identify subsets of patients who benefit from ACE-I/ARB exposure.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Dynamics of liver stiffness measurement and clinical course of primary biliary cholangitis.\r\nTracking longitudinal changes in LSM using VCTE provides valuable insights into PBC prognosis, offering a robust predictive measure for the risk of SCE. LSM could be used as a clinically relevant surrogate endpoint in PBC clinical trials.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMucosal Healing With Vedolizumab in Patients with Chronic Pouchitis: EARNEST, a Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial.\r\n Vedolizumab induced endoscopic improvements in patients with chronic pouchitis, which was associated with improved outcomes at W34, particularly in patients achieving MH at W14.  number, NCT02790138.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndosc Int Open\r\n    Learning curve for endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) in the United States: Large, untutored, single-operator experience.\r\nFollowing ex-vivo training in an animal model, an untutored expert operator achieved competency in ESD between 250 and 350 procedures. Our data can inform development of future training programs in the West.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMortality from upper gastrointestinal tumors in colorectal cancer screening patients.\r\n10 mm and HGD. Future studies will demonstrate whether integrated screening with additional gastroscopy is effective in CRC screening participants with large or highly dysplastic polyps.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nValue of green sign and chicken skin aspects for detecting malignancy of colorectal neoplasia in a prospective characterization study.\r\nThe green sign may be associated with malignant colorectal neoplasia. Targeting these areas before precise analysis of the lesion could be a way of improving detection of focal malignancies and prediction of the most severe histology.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopy\r\n    A Sub-epithelial Lesion Algorithm For Endoscopic (SAFE) Resection In The Upper Gastrointestinal Tract.\r\n U-SELs may be effectively and safely treated by endoscopic resection. The SAFE approach provides a framework that facilitates structured decision-making. Oesophageal U-SELs suspected to involve the MP should undergo STER. Gastric SELs can be best managed by ESD with a view to proceed to exposing-EFTR. A laparoscopic UGI surgeon should be available in case surgical retrieval of the specimen or laparoscopic completion is required.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nComparative Outcomes of Endoscopic Mucosal Resection for Laterally Spreading Lesions in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\nRecurrence of LSLs after EMR appears more frequent in patients with IBD. Given the added complexity, EMR in patients with IBD should be performed in expert centers with close endoscopic surveillance.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCorrelation of EUS-guided portal pressure gradient measurements with hepatic venous pressure gradient: a prospective study.\r\nThe correlation between EUS-PPG and HVPG was almost perfect. EUS-PPG could be a safe and reliable method for direct PPG measurement in cirrhotic patients and a valid alternative to HVPG. NCT05689268.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEffect of Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation Based on Wrist-Ankle Acupuncture Theory for Pain Relief during Non-Anesthetic Colonoscopy: A Randomized Controlled Trial.\r\n TENS-WAA effectively reduces pain during non-anesthetized colonoscopy, especially in male participants, providing a promising non-invasive analgesic method.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPolyp size measurement during colonoscopy using a virtual scale: variability and systematic differences.\r\nWe evaluated the method-specific variance (as measure of variability) in polyp size measurements and systematic differences between these methods. Results Variance in polyp size measurements was significantly lower for VS measurements compared to visual and snare measurements for both experts (0.52 vs 1.59 and 1.96, p Use of the VS leads to lower polyp size measurement variability and more uniform polyp sizing by individual endoscopists compared to visual and snare measurements.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Cancer-associated endocrine cells participate in pancreatic carcinogenesis.\r\nOur study systematically maps the alteration of pancreatic endocrine cells in PDAC and elucidates the potential endocrine-exocrine interaction mechanisms during PDAC carcinogenesis. Meanwhile, we first time define and characterize cancer-associated endocrine cells (CAEs), thereby further broadening the composition of PDAC microenvironment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe global incident gastrointestinal cancers attributable to suboptimal diets from 1990 to 2018.\r\nAlthough the proportional attributable GI incidence remains relatively stable, the doubling of absolute cases from 1990 to 2018, along with the discrepancies among urbanicity and countries/regions, informs dietary priorities and more targeted preventive measures.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    A prospective randomized controlled trial of water exchange plus cap versus water exchange colonoscopy in unsedated Veterans.\r\nUnsedated colonoscopy was appropriate for unescorted Veterans. WE alone was sufficient. Adding a cap did not reduce RTMIP. Patient specific factors and application of WE with insertion suction of infused water contributed to high and low RTMIP, respectively. For unesorted patients, selecting those with low anxiety, avoiding low body mass index, history of depression or self-reported poor health and adhering to the steps of WE can minimize RTMIP to ensure success of unsedated colonoscopy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nBOOSTING EFFICIENCY IN THE ENDOSCOPY SUITE: INTEGRATING TEAM WORKFLOWS IMPROVES PRODUCTIVITY AND MINIMIZES COST.\r\nThis study defines variations in TOT and demonstrates that finding imbalances and sharing the workload significantly cuts costs and improves the overall efficiency of the different subgroups in the turnover process.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDistal Cap-assisted Endoscopic Mucosal Resection allows the safe and effective resection of adherent, dysplastic lesions in the setting of inflammatory bowel disease: a multicenter, retrospective study with video.\r\n EMR-DC represents an attractive option for the resection of adherent dysplastic lesions in chronic IBD which is effective, safe, and inexpensive.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nENDOSCOPIC ULTRASOUND-GUIDED HEPATICOJEJUNOSTOMY IN PATIENTS WITH HISTORY OF TOTAL GASTRECTOMY: A MULTICENTER RETROSPECTIVE FEASIBILITY STUDY.\r\n EUS-HJS is an effective and feasible procedure for patients whose anatomy has been altered by total gastrectomy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLong-term outcomes of endoscopic ultrasonography-guided balloon-occluded gastrojejunostomy bypass for malignant gastric outlet obstruction (with video).\r\nEPASS demonstrates safety and reliability in EUS-GE, offering a viable option for symptomatic malignant GOO treatment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPreparation Regimens to Improve Capsule Endoscopy visualization and diagnostic yield (PrepRICE); a multicentric randomized trial.\r\nThe group that received the bowel preparation the night before SBCE had poorer outcomes. Intra-procedure purgative regimens reduced SBTT, enhanced visualization, improved DY, and increased angioectasia detection. G4 was the best-tolerated regimen.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTHE ROLE OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE CHOLANGIOPANCREATOGRAPHY FOR PREVENTING PANCREATIC FLUID COLLECTION RECURRENCE AFTER EUS-GUIDED DRAINAGE OF WALLED-OFF NECROSIS.\r\n Patients with WON who underwent MRCP prior to transmural stent removal had a lower rate of PFC recurrence largely due to the identification of DPD with appropriate endoscopic management.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    Circulating tumour DNA in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma across tumour stages and treatments.\r\n ctDNA offers dynamic information reflecting tumour biology. It represents a non-invasive tool useful to guide HCC clinical management.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFaecal proteomics links neutrophil degranulation with mortality in patients with alcohol-associated hepatitis.\r\nWe found an increased abundance of faecal proteins linked to neutrophil degranulation in patients with AH, which is predictive of short-term survival and could serve as a prognostic non-invasive marker.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHBcrAg values may predict virological and immunological responses to pegIFN-α in NUC-suppressed HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B.\r\nPegIFN-α treatment can induce greater functional T cell improvement and HBsAg decline in patients with lower baseline HBcrAg levels. Thus, HBcrAg may represent an easily and reliably applicable parameter to select patients who are more likely to achieve better response to pegIFN-α add-on to virally suppressed patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImpact of prenatal and postnatal maternal IBD status on offspring's risk of IBD: a population-based cohort study.\r\n Offspring had a greater risk of IBD when either parent was diagnosed before childbirth rather than later, emphasising genetic predisposition and environmental risk factors rather than maternal inflammation in utero as risk factors for IBD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    Acute kidney injury in severe alcohol-associated hepatitis treated with anakinra plus zinc or prednisone.\r\nAKI occurred more frequently and was more severe in A+Z-treated participants. A+Z-treated participants with AKI had higher uNGAL, suggesting that A+Z maybe nephrotoxic in sAH patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAg-driven CD8+ T cell clonal expansion is a prominent feature of MASH in humans and mice.\r\nMASH-induced human cirrhosis and diet-induced MASH in mice resulted in the accumulation of activated and clonally expanded T cells in the liver. The clonally expanded T cells in the liver expressed markers of chronic antigenic stimulation, including PD1, TIGIT, and TOX. Overall, this study establishes for the first time that T cells undergo Ag-dependent clonal expansion and functional differentiation during the progression of MASH. These studies could lead to the identification of antigenic targets that drive T cell activation, clonal expansion, and recruitment to the liver during MASH.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCX3CR1+ macrophages interact with hepatic stellate cells to promote hepatocellular carcinoma through CD8+ T cell suppression.\r\n We showed that CX3CR1+Ly6C+ macrophages migrate and interact with aHSCs in the peritumoral region where retinoids induce arginase-1 expression in CX3CR1+Ly6C+ macrophages, subsequently depriving CD8+ T cells of arginine and promoting HCC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDevelopment and validation of pFIB scores for exclusion of significant liver fibrosis in pediatric MASLD.\r\nAnalyzing several cohorts totaling approximately 1100 children and adolescents, we developed novel risk scores incorporating readily available clinical variables. In accordance with the aim of excluding pediatric MASLD-associated fibrosis, the scores performed better in non-selected cohorts of children and adolescents living with obesity than in patients referred to tertiary liver units.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDrug interaction with Udp-Glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes is a predictor of drug-induced liver injury.\r\nNotably, drug interactions with UGT enzymes may independently predict DILI, and their combined use with the rule-of-two model further improves overall predictive performance. These findings could expand the currently available tools for assessing the potential for DILI in humans.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndothelial RUNX3 controls LSEC dysfunction and angiocrine LRG1 signaling to prevent liver fibrosis.\r\nRUNX3 deficiency in the endothelium induces LSEC dysfunction, LRG1 secretion, and liver fibrosis progression. Therefore, endothelial RUNX3 is a crucial gatekeeping factor in LSECs, and profibrotic angiocrine LRG1 may be a novel target for combating liver fibrosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEpigenetic heterogeneity hotspots in human liver disease progression.\r\n Substantial epigenetic heterogeneity arises early in liver disease development, targeting key pathways in the progression and initiation of both cirrhosis and HCC. Integration of epigenetic and transcriptional heterogeneity unveils putative epigenetic regulators of hepatocarcinogenesis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nExome-wide association analysis identifies novel risk loci for alcohol-associated hepatitis. \r\nPolygenic signals for AH were observed in both common and rare variant analysis and identified genes with roles associated with inflammation. This study has identified two new genes of high effect size with a previously unknown contribution to ALD, and highlights both the overlap in etiology between liver diseases, and the unique origins of AH.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatic decompensation is the major driver of mortality in hepatocellular carcinoma patients treated with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab: The impact of successful antiviral treatment.\r\nHepatic decompensation identifies patients with the worst prognosis following AB and is more common in patients with baseline ALBI>1 and non-viral aetiology. Effective antiviral treatment may protect from decompensation, highlighting the prognostic disadvantage of patients with non-viral aetiologies and the importance of multi-disciplinary management to maximise OS.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver stiffness progression in biopsy-proven metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic disease among people with diabetes versus people without diabetes: A prospective multicenter study.\r\n Utilizing serial VCTE data from a multicenter study of participants with biopsy-proven MASLD, we demonstrate that T2DM and HbA1c are associated with LSM progression.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver transplantation provides survival benefit at all levels of frailty: From the Multicenter Functional Assessment in Liver Transplantation Study.\r\n Pre-LT and, to a lesser degree, post-LT mortality increased as LFI increased. Transplant offered a survival benefit at al LFI values, driven by a reduction in pre-LT mortality. No threshold of LFI was identified at which the risk of post-LT mortality exceeded pre-LT mortality. LT offers net survival benefit even in the presence of advanced frailty among those selected for LT.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPGD2/DP1 axis promotes liver regeneration by secreting Wnt2 in Kupffer cells in mice.\r\nDP1 activation mediates crosstalk between KCs and hepatocytes through Wnt2, and facilitates liver regeneration. Hence, DP1 may serve as a novel therapeutic target in acute and chronic liver diseases.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Editorial: Decoding the enigma-Navigating complexity in MASLD management.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: GLP-1 receptor agonists in inflammatory bowel disease-Is it time?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Leveraging existing mid-end ultrasound machine for point-of-care intestinal ultrasound in low-resource settings-Prospective, real-world impact on clinical decision making.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Trajectory of soluble programmed cell death protein-1 and ligand-1 in HBV-infected individuals treated with pegylated interferon-implications for stopping rules and the HBV cure programme.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReview article: advances in the diagnosis and management of anorectal motility disorders.\r\nAnorectal motility disorders are common, but either less well recognized or poorly managed by most gastroenterologists.

Herein we consider the available literature with regard to identifying the intended population for treatment with resmetirom and in proposing criteria for stopping treatment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIBD Matchmaking - Rational Combination Therapy.\r\nBoth treatment exposure and disease duration are major determinants of response to therapy. Identification of safe and effective CATT may impact positioning of this strategy to apply to a broader IBD population.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTHE FUTURE OF CLINICAL TRIALS IN INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE.\r\nAccordingly, innovative methods for both early and late phase RCTs must be adopted. In this Review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the evolution of modern IBD trials, discuss methods for improving trial efficiency both in early and late phase development, and provide insights into the interpretation and implications of these data for clinical care.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Discrepant Visual Representation of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases in the Internet and Media.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe IBD Clinic of Tomorrow: Holistic, Patient-Centric, and Value-based Care.\r\nWe also suggest potential opportunities for IBD practitioners to incorporate elements of holistic care on a local scale. Together, we hope such care models will enhance not only IBD-specific health outcomes, but also improve the general wellbeing of our patients with IBD today and tomorrow.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    EUS-guided radiofrequency ablation in pancreatic cancer: Promising but still questionable!\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopic ultrasonography for liver palpation: A modern extension of the physical examination?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFreeze frame: Is spray cryotherapy the hot new thing for Barrett's dysplasia?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRed dichromatic imaging: going deeper with electronic chromoendoscopy.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe perfect tool for endoscopic necrosectomy: Miracle or a mirage?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    Cellular immunotherapies and immune cell depleting therapies in inflammatory bowel diseases: the next magic bullet?\r\nThis article discusses novel cellular immunotherapies and immune cell depleting therapies in IBD, including CAR-T cell approaches, Tr1 and T regulatory (Treg) cells and cell depleting antibodies such as rosnilimab.
