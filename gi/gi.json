Despite considerable progress in understanding H-IRI, further research is needed to identify additional therapeutic targets, particularly in the context of ECD livers, to develop effective, targeted interventions that can improve clinical outcomes.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Predictors of fibrosis, clinical events and mortality in MASLD: Data from the Global-MASLD study.\nIn this large global biopsy-based MASLD cohort, advanced fibrosis was highly prevalent and strongly linked to T2D. Both histologic fibrosis and NITs were independent predictors of mortality and clinical outcomes, underscoring the prognostic value of fibrosis assessment with non-invasive tests.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx J Hepatol\n    An etiology-stratified single-cell atlas identifies FABP4 as a prognostic marker for MASLD-related HCC.\nThese findings reveal etiology-heterogeneous immune landscapes in HCC and identify FABP4 as a potential prognostic biomarker to guide immunotherapy in MASLD-related HCC. Impact and implications This study systematically analyzed the impact of HBV, MASLD, and their coexistence on the response and outcomes of immunotherapy in HCC. By integrating single-cell sequencing of patient samples, it highlights the importance of etiological heterogeneity, particularly from the perspective of CD8 + T cells. The study identifies FABP4 as being highly expressed in MASLD-related HCC and implicates it in promoting vascular normalization and CD8 + T cell infiltration. Most importantly, FABP4 emerges as a potential prognostic biomarker for HCC, especially in MASLD-related cases, offering a practical tool to identify patients who are more likely to benefit from immunotherapy.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx DNAJ-PKAc induces metabolic rewiring and enhanced glutamine flux in fibrolamellar HCC.\n The presence of DNAJ-PKAc creates a vulnerability to the combination of glutamine antimetabolite and ICI therapy in FLC. Impact and implications The DNAJ-PKAc fusion in fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) induces metabolic reprogramming including enhanced glutamine metabolism, which promotes immune evasion. Targeting this metabolic vulnerability with a glutamine antagonist, in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, reverses the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), offering a promising therapeutic strategy for FLC treatment.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Safety and efficacy of REP 2139-Mg in patients with HDV-related advanced liver disease in an international compassionate access program.\nREP treatment was safe and effective in HDV patients with ACLD. REP may even induce HDV sustained virological response and HBV functional cure independent of combination with pegIFN. Clinical benefits may also be observed in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Impact and implications No antiviral treatment is approved for chronic hepatitis D (CHD) patients with decompensated cirrhosis or in patients who have failed previous bulevirtide and/or pegIFN therapy. In the Replicor Compassionate Access Program including 33 CHD patients with advanced chronic liver disease treated with REP2139-Mg (REP) and nucleotide analog, with or without pegylated interferon, loss of HBsAg was observed in 27% by end of treatment and remained undetectable in 18% after one year follow up, inferring HDV sustained virological response and HBV functional cure for these patients. Among the 6 patients with decompensated cirrhosis, five patients had virological response and two patients presented significant clinical improvement with ascites reduction, with no REP-related serious adverse events. Overall, the efficacy of REP, in this \"difficult to treat\" population, appears promising with acceptable tolerability and no safety issues and should be evaluated in a protocol driven, response-guided clinical trial.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \n\n\nReviews&Editorials\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\npublisher website using the provided link\n\n\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\n    Editorial: Comparable Hepatic Fibrosis Risk Demands Equal Vigilance in Lean and Non-Lean Patients With Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease.\n\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Review Article: The Evolving Role of GLP-1 Receptor Agonists in Gastroenterology Practice.\nGlucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists are a critical therapy for obesity and several related gastrointestinal conditions.

The degree of BU improvement was similar among agents. Areas for future research include investigation of BU outcomes with other IBD therapies, exploration of underlying mechanisms of action, and greater standardisation for measuring BU through validated scores.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Systematic Review: Stigma Associated With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\n This highlights the heterogeneity in stigma assessment methods and the need for more standardised research. It also emphasises the importance of addressing stigma through increased awareness, support and interventions aimed at enhancing resilience and coping skills.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Waitlist and Post-Transplant Outcomes in Liver Transplantation for Alcohol-Associated Liver Disease: An Individual Patient Data Meta-Analysis.\n In this reconstructed individual patient data meta-analysis, waitlist survival was comparable between ALD and non-ALD patients. While early post-transplant patient survival was similar, long-term survival remained inferior in ALD, partly attributed to increased de novo malignancy. These findings highlight the need for improved candidate selection, addiction care, and cancer surveillance to maximise long-term outcomes in the growing ALD transplant population.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Endoscopy\n    Environmental footprint of gastrointestinal endoscopy services: a systematic review.\n - Current evidence on the environmental impact of GI endoscopy services is fragmented, methodologically inconsistent, and often limited in coverage. Emissions were dominated by patient travel, energy use and procedure-related products. Broader and more standardized environmental assessments are needed to guide the transition to low-carbon, sustainable GI endoscopy. .\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Hepatology\n    Technical systematic review supporting 2025 AASLD Practice Guidelines on management of chronic hepatitis B.\nDespite low certainty, the findings support shared decision-making in high-risk horizontal transmission scenarios or in treating individuals in the immune tolerance phase, caution in discontinuing antiviral therapy in virologically suppressed individuals without HBsAg loss, and tailored HCC surveillance for those with co-infection or cirrhosis.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \n\n\nOriginal articles\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\n\n\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\n    Indocyanine Green Clearance Correlates With Biomarkers Reflecting Key Disease-Driving Mechanisms in Advanced Chronic Liver Disease and Predicts Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure and Death.\nICG-R15 by PDD correlates with portal hypertension and systemic inflammation/circulatory dysfunction as key disease-driving mechanisms in ACLD. While showing insufficient discrimination for CSPH, ICG-R15 independently predicted ACLF/liver-related mortality in decompensated cirrhosis.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Very Early-Stage Detection Is Associated With Improved Survival in Patients With Unifocal Hepatocellular Carcinoma.\nDetection of HCC at a T1a stage conveys a survival advantage compared to T1b stage, underscoring a continued need for improvements in HCC surveillance efficacy.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Am J Gastroenterol\n    Use of Natural language processing to objectively identify hepatic encephalopathy in multiple cohorts.\nFive signs, symptoms, and treatment decisions with simple phrases extracted from inpatient charts using NLP define HE across three cohorts.

Models comprising indicators of portal hypertension and albumin discriminated between patients at negligible decompensation risk and those with a 1-year risk of ≈15%, i.e., the potential target population for preventive strategies. Impact and implications Non-invasive tests (NITs) facilitate the early diagnosis and management of clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) in patients with compensated advanced chronic liver disease (cACLD) patients. In our contemporary cohort of cACLD patients with mainly steatotic liver disease recruited at 16 European expert centres, the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) and NITs were similarly predictive of decompensation within one to two years of follow-up. Serum albumin levels were identified as the second main predictor of decompensation besides the HVPG or NITs for CSPH. Novel models were developed that could accurately predict the risk for decompensation, thereby refining point-of-care risk stratification and clinical trial design in CTP-A cACLD patients.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Setd4-expressing cells drive regenerative recovery in chronic liver injury.\nAs a reserve population, dormant Setd4 + cells survive during chronic injury and then, beyond activation via chromatin remodelling, initiate de novo regeneration fundamental for recovery after chronic injury.

Our findings suggest positioning NCGWS within the spectrum of disorders of gut-brain interaction once organic pathologies have been excluded.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx J Hepatol\n    Refining the Baveno VII criteria for clinically significant portal hypertension: an individual-patient data meta-analysis.\n Baveno VII criteria for CSPH adequately classify patients across etiologies, except MASLD with obesity. Using a ≥75% risk threshold by ANTICIPATE models to detect CSPH improves global performance, including MASLD with obesity, supporting it can be a simpler way of predicting CSPH in clinical practice. Impact and implications This systematic review and meta-analysis confirm the validity for ruling out and ruling in CSPH in cACLD patients with the Baveno VII criteria. Using a threshold of ≥75% of the ANTICIPATE±NASH models, the global performance for detecting CSPH improves regardless of etiology. This represents a very practical approach for general hepatologists to select patients for prophylactic β-blocker therapy as its calculation relies on BMI, liver stiffness and platelet count with an online calculator.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \n\n\nOriginal articles\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\n\n\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\n    High Risk of Colorectal Cancer After High-Grade Dysplasia in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients.\nThe risk of synchronous and metachronous CRC after a diagnosis of high-grade dysplasia underlines the high-risk profile of this subgroup of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

This process narrows the lumen and may promote PVT. EndMT plays a key role in this transformation and emerges as a novel and promising therapeutic target. Notably, statins can attenuate EndMT, highlighting its potential in PVT treatment.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx J Hepatol\n    Utilization of liver grafts obtained from donation after medical assistance in dying: A Canadian multicenter experience.\nLiver grafts from MAiD donor may be successfully transplanted with comparable outcomes to DCD-III and contributed to a 21.8% increase of DCD activity across Canada. These results encourage additional efforts to consider MAiD as a valuable additional source of liver grafts. Further studies and larger clinical experience are necessary to validate these results. Impact and implications Liver transplantation with grafts following medical assistance in dying has satisfactory patients and graft survival rates, and the incidence of major post-operative events and complications were comparable with the standard circulatory death donors.Cumulatively, medical assistance in dying donors contributed to a significant increase of the donation after circulatory death liver transplantation activity in Canada by 21.8% in a 7-year period.This data encourages to pursue donation following medical assistance in dying as a valuable additional source of grafts, also allowing to fulfill patient's wishes to donate their organs and help others.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \n\n\nReviews&Editorials\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\npublisher website using the provided link\n\n\n    Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol\n    Blue Notes.\n\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Strategies to Promote Health Equity in Professional Society Clinical Guidance in Gastroenterology.\n\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx J Hepatol\n    BCLC strategy for prognosis prediction and treatment recommendations: The 2025 update.\nThese updates are particularly important for clinicians, tumor boards, and guideline developers, as well as for patients and caregivers who face complex choices in real-world practice.

Weight loss (≥ 5%) enhanced the efficacy of resmetirom.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx High Risk of Colorectal Cancer After High-Grade Dysplasia in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients.\r\nThe risk of synchronous and metachronous CRC after a diagnosis of high-grade dysplasia underlines the high-risk profile of this subgroup of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The possible advantages of colon-sparing treatment should be balanced with the higher risk of metachronous CRC and the subsequent need for stringent endoscopic surveillance.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Maternal and Perinatal Outcomes in Pregnant Women With Comorbid Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Chronic Liver Disease.\r\nCoexisting IBD and CLD confer compounded maternal and perinatal risks beyond either condition alone. Multidisciplinary care and risk-based screening for underlying CLD in pregnant women are warranted.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Persistence of Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Longitudinal Follow-Up Study.\r\n Poor psychological health persists for a substantial number of patients with IBD. Further work is needed to establish the long-term effect of mood trajectories on disease outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Research Communication: Changing Aetiology of Chronic Liver Diseases in East Asia Pacific and HCC Surveillance in Non-Cirrhotic Patients.\r\nHCC surveillance in non-cirrhotic patients was cost-effective only for chronic hepatitis B in selected older age groups, with substantial variability across countries. These findings support refining surveillance guidelines and adaptation of risk stratification tools.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Research Communication: Teriflunomide Does Not Affect Gluten-Specific T-Cell Activity in Coeliac Disease-A Randomised, Placebo-Controlled Trial.\r\nThe main aim was to observe attenuation of gluten-specific T-cell activation markers after gluten exposure. We found no significant differences in T-cell activity between groups, concluding that teriflunomide is ineffective as a non-dietary treatment for coeliac disease.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Treatment-Free Outcomes Following Surgery for IBD: A Nationwide Cohort Study.\r\nSurgery obviated the need for future therapy in 22% of patients with CD and 42% with UC. Absence of extraintestinal manifestations, older age in UC, and longer disease duration and absence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in CD may highlight an opportunity for precision surgery to identify those most likely to achieve long-term benefit from surgical intervention.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Am J Gastroenterol\r\n    Comparative Safety of Advanced Therapies in Patients with Ulcerative Colitis: An Administrative Claims-based Study.\r\nIn a real-world cohort of patients with UC, anti-interleukins and JAK inhibitors were associated with lower risk of serious infections and may offer net benefit, especially in patients with prior TNF antagonist exposure.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Demodicosis Mimics Acneiform Eruptions in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease Receiving Upadacitinib: A Case Series.\r\nDemodicosis should be considered in patients with IBD having acneiform eruptions, particularly those receiving upadacitinib.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Effects of Screening Colonoscopy: Evidence From Observational and Interventional Studies.\r\nWe conclude that, despite apparent differences in reported results, both observational and interventional provide compelling evidence for strong preventive effects of screening colonoscopy. On the population level, similarly strong incidence and mortality reduction might be reached by well-organized screening programs achieving higher adherence rates with less invasive screening tests.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Impact of Artificial Intelligence Use on Endoscopist Optical Diagnosis of Sessile Serrated Lesions, Traditional Serrated Adenomas and Advanced Conventional Adenomas.\r\nCADx use did neither significantly harm nor improve optical diagnostic performance for SSLs despite CADx inability to classify SSLs.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Per-oral endoscopic myotomy-induced reduction of crural diaphragm contractility might contribute to development of post-procedural reflux esophagitis.\r\nPOEM can impair CD contraction, and weak CD contraction was associated with post-POEM RE.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx The Risk of Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\n While the risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy overall was not increased in pregnancies affected by IBD, there was an increased risk of preeclampsia. This may reflect underlying immune-mediated placental dysfunction.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx The impact of E-Cigarettes and Heat-Not-Burn Tobacco on Postoperative Recurrence of Crohn's Disease: A Multicenter International Study.\r\n HNBT, and possibly e-cigarettes, are associated with increased endoscopic recurrence of CD compared to non-smoking.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Utility of quantitative fecal immunochemical test values for average risk colorectal cancer screening risk stratification among patients with a positive test.\r\n Neoplastic findings occurred across the whole spectrum of qFIT values, emphasising the need for colonoscopy for al positive qFIT tests. However, increasing qFIT values correlated with the PPV for CRC and advanced adenoma and may help to stratify patients at highest risk for detecting serious neoplastic lesions in resource-constrained settings.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Recent Trends of Incidence, Mortality, Treatment, and Overall Survival of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in the United States.\r\n HCC incidence rates have started to decline, and incidence-based mortality has plateaued. Given lower early-stage detection and curative treatments during the COVID-19 pandemic, longer-term follow-up is warranted to assess the impact on survival. The reduced survival disparities between non-Hispanic Black and White patients may reflect improved equitable medical access.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Seroprevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection among asymptomatic patients served by a safety-net healthcare system.\r\n In this population-based study, almost two-thirds of asymptomatic patients were seropositive for H. pylori. Prevalence was over 40% among al sub-groups. Screening solely based on race and ethnicity may inadvertently exacerbate disparities by overlooking confounding factors for infection like low socioeconomic status and regional exposures.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Endoscopy\r\n    Individuals with polyps ≥10mm without other high-risk features have a similarly low post-colonoscopy colorectal cancer risk as those with no polyps.\r\nPCCRC-risk 5 years after baseline colonoscopy within individuals with polyps ≥10mm without other high-risk features is not significantly different from individuals without polyps at baseline. Lengthening surveillance intervals would affect 79% of high-risk individuals with ≥10mm polyps as their sole high-risk feature, and 46% if limited to those with 10-20mm polyps.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Intraductal Cryobiopsy via Percutaneous Cholangioscopy for Biliary Strictures: a Multicenter Feasibility Study.\r\nThis feasibility study showed that intraductal cryobiopsy via percutaneous cholangioscopy yielded larger samples and may enable more detailed histologic assessment than forceps biopsies. Further studies will evaluate its accuracy, safety, and potential for use with peroral cholangioscopy during ERCP.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Gastroenterology\r\n    Comparative Efficacy of Advanced Therapies for Management of Moderate-to-Severe Crohn's Disease: 2025 AGA Evidence Synthesis.\r\nUsing Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation to appraise quality of evidence, this updated network meta-analysis can inform positioning of advanced therapies for the treatment of biologic-naïve and biologic-exposed patients with moderate-to-severe CD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Intestinal LKB1 Loss Drives a Premalignant Program Along the Serrated Cancer Pathway.\r\nHeterozygous loss of LKB1 pushes intestinal cells into a chronic regenerative state, which is amplified on loss of heterozygosity. Lkb1 deficiency thereby generates fertile ground for serrated colorectal cancer formation in the intestine, potentially explaining the increased cancer risk observed in PJS.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Retraction Notice to: \"CSF1 Restores Innate Immunity After Liver Injury in Mice and Serum Levels Indicate Outcomes of Patients With Acute Liver Failure\" Gastroenterology 2015;149:1896-1909.e14.\r\nThe authors requested that this paper be retracted in 2019, and the Editors of Gastroenterology agree that this manuscript should be retracted. Dr Daniel Antoine played no part in any other aspects of this manuscript, and the authors have confidence in al other data.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Gastrointest Endosc\r\n    Best practices for Endoscopic Ultrasound-guided Gastroenterostomy: technical recommendations from an International modified Delphi process.\r\nDespite technical differences (such as the preference of a jejunal catheter or a double-balloon catheter) most EUS-GE experts agree on key technical principles, providing valuable guidance on the standardization of EUS-GE in clinical practice. Conversely, certain topics show limited agreement, identifying future research priorities in the field of EUS-GE.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Extended Surveillance After Piecemeal Endoscopic Mucosal Resection: A Safe Approach to Initial Surveillance in Low-Risk Patients.\r\n A risk-stratified approach may safely extend surveillance to 12 months for lower-risk patients following piecemeal EMR, reducing unnecessary procedures without compromising care.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Peroral cholangioscopy-guided laser-stricturoplasty for intrahepatic benign biliary strictures (with video).\r\n This pilot study suggests that POCS-LAS is a technically feasible and potentially effective treatment for intrahepatic BBS.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Gut\r\n    PDE5A<sup>+<\/sup> cancer-associated fibroblasts enhance immune suppression in gastric cancer.\r\nOur study elucidates the intricate role of PDE5A + CAFs in shaping the immunosuppressive TME in GC, providing mechanistic insights and therapeutic potential for combating this aggressive malignancy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx SMYD2-mediated methylation of STAT1 protects against hepatic ischaemia/reperfusion injury by blocking JAK-STAT1 signalling pathways.\r\n This study establishes SMYD2 as a novel negative regulator of STAT1 activity through K175 methylation, providing new insights into the epigenetic control of STAT1 during hepatic I/R injury. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognised mechanism for fine-tuning STAT1 signalling in hepatic I/R injury, and targeting the SMYD2-STAT1 axis may present a promising therapeutic strategy for mitigating I/R-associated liver damage.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx iPSC-induced multilineage liver organoids, small intestinal organoids and brain organoids sustain pangenotype hepatitis E virus propagation.\r\n This study established iPSC-induced multilineage organoid infection models, confirming HEV's capacity for pan-tissue infection and revealing potential pathogenic mechanisms in the liver, intestine and nervous system. This platform provides valuable tools for HEV virology research and antiviral drug development, underscoring the unique value of organoid technology in infectious disease research.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Hepatology\r\n    Glutamine synthetase loss in β-catenin-mutant hepatocellular carcinoma promotes tumor burden through macrophage metabolic reprogramming.\r\nWe demonstrate unique metabolic dependency of β-catenin-mutated HCCs on GS in tumor cells which is diverted to macrophages upon GS elimination in tumor cells. This adaptation alters macrophage metabolism and function leading to compromised immunosurveillance and greater tumor burden. Our study reveals a metabolic dynamic between HCC cells and macrophages with impact on tumor biology.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Hepatectomy alters adjuvant anti-PD-1 action in a mouse model of HCC but does not compromise neoadjuvant efficacy.\r\nPartial hepatectomy disrupts antitumor immunity and limits adjuvant ICI efficacy. Neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 immunotherapy offers a superior strategy compared to adjuvant immunotherapy in enhancing immune responses and reducing HCC recurrence.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx MSR1+ macrophages passivate antitumor immunity by inducing ITM2A+ CD4T exhaustion differentiation.\r\nMSR1+macrophages promote tumor-infiltrating ITM2A+CD4T exhaustion differentiation by regulating the ITM2A-ZAP70 axis. ZEA-αCD4 specifically targeted MSR1-ITM2A interaction to activate antitumor immunity and improve the efficacy of αPDL1 immunotherapy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Reclassifying pediatric NAFLD using the steatotic liver disease framework: a multicenter retrospective study from the NASH CRN.\r\nMost children with NAFLD met MASLD criteria, but nearly 1 in 6 were reclassified based on alcohol use or medication exposure. These findings highlight the need for a systematic diagnostic approach accounting for metabolic risk factors, alcohol use, and medication-related liver injury.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Serum bile acid levels predict the development of portal hypertension and high-risk esophageal varices following successful Kasai in biliary atresia.\r\n In biliary atresia patients with successful KP, sBA is an early biomarker predicting the development of PH and HRV within 5 years post-KP.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx J Hepatol\r\n    HBx-induced HSPB1 is a potential therapeutic target owing to its modulation of HBV cccDNA and hepatic immune responses.\r\nHSPB1 represents a novel therapeutic target by modulating HBV cccDNA and immune responses in the liver. D-TK is a promising clinical candidate for HBV treatment through cccDNA suppression and immune activation. Impact and implications Chronic infection with HBV remains a significant global health concern, and current therapeutic options are inadequate. In this study, we demonstrate that HBx-induced elevation of HSPB1 contributes to the regulation of HBV cccDNA and the hepatic immune responses. We engineered a peptide, D-TK, that targets HBx, effectively suppresses cccDNA, and activates immune responses through HSPB1. Our findings offer new insights into the mechanism by which HBx-induced HSPB1 modulates HBV cccDNA and immune regulation in the liver.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Microbial metabolism dysfunction induced by transarterial chemoembolization aggravates postprocedural liver injury in HCC.\r\nThis is the first study to identify gut microbiota disturbance, i.e., deficiency of L. reuteri metabolite ILA, as significant cause of TACE-LI. L. reuteri and ILA administration serves as promising therapeutic approach for TACE-LI, which is crucial for reducing TACE adverse effects to achieve better prognosis in HCC. Impact and implications The majority of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are diagnosed losing the chance of surgical resection. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is widely used for treating unresectable HCC;  however, its long-term outcome is significantly limited by its main complication, i.e., liver injury (LI). In addition to traditional cognition of the direct liver damage of the ischemic necrosis or regional chemotherapy induced by TACE, the deeper mechanisms underlying TACE-induced LI (TACE-LI) remain largely unclear. Gut microbiota can modulate various liver diseases but its exact role in TACE-LI has not been reported. We found that TACE could disturb the gut microbiota. This disturbance was characterized by reduced levels of Limosilactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) and its metabolite indole-3-lactic acid (ILA), which were correlated with aggravated TACE-LI and poor overall survival in HCC. Administration of L. reuteri or ILA significantly improved TACE-LI by inhibiting the inflammation of macrophages. Our study is the first report highlighting gut microbiota disturbances as an important cause of TACE-LI;  administration of L. reuteri or ILA represents a viable and secure strategy for preventing TACE-LI, thereby reducing the adverse effects of TACE and yielding better prognoses in patients with HCC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are
