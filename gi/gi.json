Clinical guidelines should emphasize the addition of aerobic exercise in lifestyle treatments for the greatest histologic benefit in individuals with advanced MASH. Clinical trial number NCT03151798.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHistological predictors of aggressive recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma after liver resection.\r\n The presence of mVI/S was the only independent risk factor for aggressive recurrence and mortality. This has important implications for early-stage patient management, especially in the setting of adjuvant immunotherapy or ab initio LT.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nProcoagulant phenotype of virus-infected pericytes is associated with portal thrombosis and intrapulmonary vascular dilations in fatal COVID-19.\r\nSARS-CoV-2 infection of liver pericytes elicits a local procoagulant response associated with extensive portal microthrombosis, IPVD and worsening respiratory failure in fatal COVID-19. Impact and implications Vascular involvement of the liver represents a serious complication of COVID-19 infection that must be considered in the work-up of patients with long-lasting and progressively worsening respiratory failure, as it may associate with the development of intrapulmonary vascular dilations. This clinical picture is associated with a pro-coagulant phenotype of portal venule pericytes, which is induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection of pericytes. Both observations provide a model that may apply, at least in part, to other vascular disorders of the liver, featuring obliterative portal venopathy, similarly characterized at the clinical level by development of hypoxemia and at the histological level, by phlebosclerosis and reduced caliber of the portal vein branches in the absence of cirrhosis. Moreover, our findings bring light to an as yet overlooked player of thrombosis pathophysiology, i.e. pericytes, which may provide novel therapeutic tools to halt prothrombotic mechanisms.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSex and ethnic disparities in hepatitis B evaluation and treatment across the world.\r\nEvaluation and treatment rates were suboptimal for patients with CHB in both the East and West, with significant sex and ethnic disparities. Improved linkage to care with linguistically competent and culturally sensitive approaches is needed. Impact and implications Significant sex and ethnic disparities exist in hepatitis B evaluation and treatment, with female treatment-eligible patients about 50% less likely to receive antiviral treatment and Asian patients from Western regions also about 50% less likely to receive adequate evaluation or treatment compared to Asians from the East (there was no significant difference between Asian patients from the East and non-Asian patients). Improved linkage to care with linguistically competent and culturally sensitive approaches is needed.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) polymorphisms may influence HDV RNA load and early response to bulevirtide.\r\nNTCP genetic polymorphisms were identified by Sanger sequencing. Results Of the 6 NTCP polymorphisms studied in 209 CHD untreated patients, carriers of rs17556915 TT/CC (N=142) compared to CT (N=67) genotype presented higher median HDV RNA levels (5.39 vs 4.75 log T genetic polymorphisms may influence baseline HDV RNA load both in untreated and BLV treated patients with CHD and may contribute to identify patients with different early virological responses to BLV.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nType-I interferon shapes peritoneal immunity in cirrhosis and drives caspase-5-mediated progranulin release upon infection.\r\nType-I IFN shapes peritoneal immune responses and regulates caspase-5-mediated progranulin release during SBP. Impact and implications Patients with cirrhosis exhibit impaired immune responses and increased susceptibility to bacterial infections. This study reveals that type-I interferon responses, triggered by pathogen-associated molecular patterns, are crucial in regulating macrophage activation and priming them for inflammatory responses. Additionally, we elucidate the mechanisms by which type-I interferons promote the release of progranulin from macrophages during spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Our findings enhance understanding of how bacterial translocation affects immune responses, identify novel biomarkers for inflammasome activation during infections, and point to potential therapeutic targets.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Editorial: Genetics for non-invasive risk stratification-Finding the needle in the haystack?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Reading the cholate: A new gateway to portal hypertension and oesophageal varices.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndosc Int Open\r\n    Retention of endoscopic capsules in diverticula: Literature review of a capsule endoscopy rarity.\r\nThe most common type is Meckel's diverticulum, and endoscopy is the primary management.

Impact and implications In this cross-sectional study, data from 7,918 participants who underwent MRE were analyzed to assess the performance of fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis scores in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and MASLD with increased alcohol intake (MetALD). We found that the newly identified MetALD group had high diagnostic accuracy with FIB-4, similar to the MASLD population. These results highlight the potential of FIB-4 as a reliable screening tool for MetALD, even when specific subgroups are considered. Therefore, FIB-4 is a valuable screening tool for identifying advanced fibrosis in the MetALD population.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEpigenetic scars in regulatory T cells are retained after successful treatment of chronic hepatitis C with direct-acting antivirals.\r\nHere we longitudinally examined phenotypic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic alterations in peripheral blood regulatory T (T cells are maintained at phenotypic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic levels even after successful DAA treatment. Further in-depth studies are required to investigate the long-term clinical outcomes of patients who have recovered from chronic HCV infection.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPrimary cilia as a targetable node between biliary injury, senescence and regeneration in liver transplantation.\r\nPrimary cilia play an essential role in biliary regeneration and we demonstrate that senolytics and cilia-stabilising treatments provide a potential therapeutic opportunity to reduce the rate of biliary complications and improve clinical outcomes in liver transplantation. Impact and implications Up to 25% of liver transplants result in biliary complications, leading to additional surgery, retransplants, or death. We found that the incidence of biliary complications is increased by damage to the primary cilium, an antenna that protrudes from the cell and is key to regeneration. Here, we show that treatments that preserve the primary cilia during the transplant process provide a potential solution to reduce the rates of biliary complications.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) polymorphisms may influence HDV RNA load and early response to bulevirtide.\r\nNTCP genetic polymorphisms were identified by Sanger sequencing.

Clinical trial number;  ClinicalTrials.gov identifier  NCT05296733. Impact and implications Survodutide is a glucagon receptor/glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor dual agonist in development for treatment of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), which causes cirrhosis in ∼20% of cases. This trial delineates the pharmacokinetic and safety profile of survodutide in people with compensated or decompensated cirrhosis, and revealed associated reductions in liver fat content, markers of liver fibrosis and body weight. These findings have potential relevance for people with MASH-including those with decompensated cirrhosis, who are usually excluded from clinical trials of investigational drugs. Based on this study, further investigation of survodutide for MASH-related cirrhosis is warranted.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Editorial: Mucosal healing with steroids: Once upon a time in ulcerative colitis.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Sonographic assessment of colonic content: A new tool for constipation?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReview article: Hepatic steatosis and its associations with acute and chronic liver diseases.\r\nDiverse liver pathologies are associated with hepatic steatosis, with MASLD being the most important contributor.

When accounting for increased injection drug use, estimated prevalence of hepatitis C is substantially higher than previously reported. National action is urgently needed to expand testing, increase access to treatment, and improve surveillance, especially among medically underserved populations, to support hepatitis C elimination goals.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIdentifying a therapeutic window of opportunity for people living with primary sclerosing cholangitis: Embryology and the overlap of inflammatory bowel disease with immune mediated liver injury.\r\nThis is critical for the optimal targeting of studies into PSC etiopathogenesis and emphasizes the concept of a \"developmental window of opportunity for therapeutic mitigation\" in what is currently recognized as an irreversible disease process. The discovery of such a window would be critically important for the targeting of interventions, both administration of current therapies and therapeutic trial planning.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMASLD/MetALD and mortality in individuals with any cardio-metabolic risk factor: a population based study with 26.7 years of follow-up.\r\n In individuals with CMRF, the presence of steatotic liver disease (MASLD) alone did not increase the risk of mortality, except in cases with more alcohol consumption (MetALD). Therefore controlling metabolic risk factors and reducing alcohol consumption in people with MASLD or MetALD will be crucial steps to improve long-term health outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTargeting cellular cathepsins inhibits hepatitis E virus entry.\r\nIn summary, our study highlights the pivotal role of lysosomal cathepsins, especially CTSL, in the HEV entry process. The profound anti-HEV efficacy of the pan-cathepsin inhibitor, K11777, especially with its notable safety profile in primary cells, further underscores its potential as a therapeutic candidate.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Bulevirtide monotherapy in patients with chronic HDV: Efficacy and safety results through week 96 from a phase 3 randomized trial.\r\nVirologic and biochemical responses were maintained and/or increased with longer-term BLV therapy, including in those with suboptimal early virologic response. BLV monotherapy for CHD was safe and well tolerated through W96. Impact and implications In July 2023, bulevirtide was fully approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis delta (CHD) in Europe based on clinical study results from up to 48 weeks of treatment. Understanding the efficacy and safety of bulevirtide over the longer term is important for healthcare providers. In this analysis, we demonstrate that bulevirtide monotherapy for 96 weeks in patients with CHD was associated with continued improvements in combined, virologic, and biochemical responses as well as liver stiffness from week 48 at both the 2-mg and 10-mg doses. Patients with suboptimal virologic responses to bulevirtide at week 24 also benefited from continued therapy, with the majority achieving virologic response or biochemical improvement by week 96.

Several factors have been proposed to explain this suboptimal performance, including the difficult liver visualization in obese and/or MASLD patients, a nodular appearance in a subset of cirrhotic livers, the skills and expertise of the operators, and poor adherence to surveillance programs.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous\r\nmisc publications eg case reports, tools of the trade, images of\r\nthe month, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Gastroenterol\r\n    Acceptability of Nonendoscopic Barrett Esophagus Screening in the Population: Some Initial Promising Answers.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Chronic hepatitis C related steatotic liver disease is more than \"miscellaneous steatotic liver disease\".\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGiant Hepatic Hemangioma.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIs a simplified, less restrictive low FODMAP diet possible?
