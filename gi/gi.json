Therefore, CRKL inhibitors combined with anti-PD-1 may be developed for the treatment of HCC. Impact and implications Here, we found CRKL was overexpressed in anti-PD-1 resistant HCC and CRKL upregulation promotes anti-PD-1 resistance in HCC. We identified that CRKL/β-catenin/VEGFα and CXCL1 axis upregulation contributes to anti-PD-1 tolerance through promoting tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) infiltration. These findings support the strategy of bevacizumab-based ICIs combination therapy, and CRKL inhibitors combined with anti-PD-1 therapy may be developed for the treatment of HCC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSingle cell landscape of functionally cured chronic hepatitis B patients reveals activation of innate and altered CD4-CTL-driven adaptive immunity.\r\nOur study provides conceptually novel insights into the immuno-pathological control of HBV cure, and opens exciting new avenues for clinical management, biomarker discovery and therapeutic interventions.

These features are exacerbated by cirrhotic ECM, highlighting the dual impact of the PNPLA3 I148M variant and the fibrotic microenvironment in progressive chronic liver diseases. Impact and implications Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) play a key role in the fibrogenic process associated with chronic liver disease. The PNPLA3 genetic mutation has been linked with increased risk of fibrogenesis, but its role in HSCs needs further investigation. Here, by using comparative transcriptomic and a novel 3D in vitro model, we demonstrate the impact of the PNPLA3 genetic mutation on primary human HSCs cell behaviour, and we show that it affects the cell's mitochondrial function and antioxidant response, as well as the antifibrotic gene NR4A1. Our publicly available transcriptomic data, 3D platform and our findings on NR4A1 could facilitate the discovery of targets to develop more effective treatments for chronic liver diseases.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Assessment and significance of histologic activity in Crohn disease.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Emerging Role of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists for the Treatment of Metabolic- Dysfunction Associated Steatohepatitis.\r\nThis review summarizes the role of glucagon-like peptide (GLP) -1 receptor agonists in treating MASLD/MASH.

Impact and implications Chronic infection with the hepatitis delta virus causes the most severe form of viral hepatitis affecting approximately 12 million people worldwide. The entry inhibitor bulevirtide (BLV) is the only recently approved anti-HDV drug, which has proven efficacious and safe in clinical trials and real-word data. Here, we investigated paired liver biopsies at baseline and after 24 or 48 weeks of treatment from three clinical trials to understand the effect of the drug on viral and host parameters in the liver, the site of viral replication. We found that BLV treatment strongly reduces the number of HDV-infected cells and signs of liver inflammation. This data implies that blocking viral entry ameliorates liver inflammation and that prolonged treatment regimens might lead to HDV cure in some patients. This concept will inform further developments of therapeutic strategies and combination treatments in CHD patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nChimeric antigen receptor-modified macrophages ameliorate liver fibrosis in preclinical models.\r\n Collectively, our findings demonstrate the potential of using macrophages as a platform for CAR technology to provide an effective treatment option for liver fibrosis.

Macrophage miR-204-3p may be a therapeutic target for MASLD. Impact and implications Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a chronic inflammatory disease ranging from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of MASLD remain incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that miR-204-3p levels in circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells are negatively correlates with disease severity in patients with MASLD. Nuclear miR-204-3p activates ULK1 transcription and improves autophagic flux, limiting macrophage activation and hepatic steatosis. Our study provides a novel understanding of the mechanism of macrophage autophagy and inflammation in steatohepatitis and suggests that miR-204-3p may act as a potential therapeutic target for MASLD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPrimary hypocholesterolemia is associated with an increased risk of hepatic complications in the general population.\r\nHBL is associated with a markedly increased risk of hepatic complications.
