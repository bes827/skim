Key implementation statements included in this document stress the importance of a high-quality endoscopy examination, sampling using a structured biopsy protocol, and confirming the diagnosis of BE-related neoplasia by an expert pathologist. This document also provides guidance on surveillance intervals and management of patients with BE-related low-grade dysplasia and indefinite for dysplasia. Providers should engage in shared decision making based on patient preferences. Limitations and gaps in the evidence are highlighted to guide future research opportunities. Guideline endorsement This guideline is endorsed by the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx AGA Clinical Practice Update on Endoscopic Resection for Early Colorectal Cancer: Commentary.\r\nThe target audience for this commentary includes primary care, gastroenterology, pathology, and surgical health care professionals. Methods This expert commentary was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC) and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership and underwent internal peer review by the CPUC and external peer review through standard procedures of Gastroenterology.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx AGA Clinical Practice Update on the Management of Ascites, Volume Overload, and Hyponatremia in Cirrhosis: Expert Review.\r\nCautious escalation can be done every 2-3 days with monitoring of volume status, kidney function, daily weights, and symptoms. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 13: Advanced strategies in refractory anasarca should be coordinated with nephrology for consideration of diuretics in the setting of contraction alkalosis (eg, addition of acetazolamide), second agent with alternate mechanism of actions (eg, thiazide diuretics, such as metolazone), or need for ultrafiltration.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Gastrointest Endosc\r\n    Consensus and consequences: Does the Baveno consensus deliver improved outcomes and survival?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\nMeta-analysis\r\nmeta-analyses and systematic reviews\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Meta-Analysis: Immune-Related Adverse Events Are Associated With Improved Effectiveness of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.\r\n irAEs, particularly dermatologic, endocrine and low-grade events, were associated with improved ICIs' effectiveness in HCC. Early irAEs detection and corticosteroid management preserve survival benefits. However, more large-scale prospective studies are needed to verify our findings.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Am J Gastroenterol\r\n    Excessive Intrapancreatic Fat Deposition and Risk of Pancreatic Diseases: Longitudinal Cohort Evidence from a Systematic Review with Population-Attributable Fraction Analysis.\r\n Longitudinal evidence generally supports the hypothesized role of excessive IPFD as a key contributor to the risk of major pancreatic diseases. The potential benefits of reducing IPFD appear to be greatest for acute pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Reevaluating the Role of Proton Pump Inhibitors After Endoscopic Band Ligation of Esophageal Varices in Cirrhotic Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.\r\n Current evidence is insufficient to support routine PPI use after EBL. RCT data remains underpowered and inconclusive, emphasizing the need for adequately powered trials.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Gastrointest Endosc\r\n    2025 best of systematic reviews and meta-analyses in gastrointestinal endoscopy.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Clinical Trial: Simplified Bowel Preparation for Small Bowel Capsule Endoscopy in Crohn's Disease.\r\nA simplified preparation consisting of a clear liquid diet and water is a viable alternative to a PEG-based preparation prior to SBCE in patients with CD, offering comparable SB cleanliness and diagnostic outcomes while improving acceptability.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Effects of Resmetirom on Metabolic-Dysfunction Associated Steatohepatitis in Patients With Weight Loss and/or Diabetes Taking Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists and Other Diabetes Therapies: A Secondary Analysis of the MAESTRO-NASH Trial.\r\nThe efficacy of resmetirom on multiple MASH endpoints was not impacted by background SGLT2i or GLP-1 RA treatment. Weight loss (≥ 5%) enhanced the efficacy of resmetirom.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx High Risk of Colorectal Cancer After High-Grade Dysplasia in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients.\r\nThe risk of synchronous and metachronous CRC after a diagnosis of high-grade dysplasia underlines the high-risk profile of this subgroup of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The possible advantages of colon-sparing treatment should be balanced with the higher risk of metachronous CRC and the subsequent need for stringent endoscopic surveillance.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Maternal and Perinatal Outcomes in Pregnant Women With Comorbid Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Chronic Liver Disease.\r\nCoexisting IBD and CLD confer compounded maternal and perinatal risks beyond either condition alone. Multidisciplinary care and risk-based screening for underlying CLD in pregnant women are warranted.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Persistence of Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Longitudinal Follow-Up Study.\r\n Poor psychological health persists for a substantial number of patients with IBD. Further work is needed to establish the long-term effect of mood trajectories on disease outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Research Communication: Changing Aetiology of Chronic Liver Diseases in East Asia Pacific and HCC Surveillance in Non-Cirrhotic Patients.\r\nHCC surveillance in non-cirrhotic patients was cost-effective only for chronic hepatitis B in selected older age groups, with substantial variability across countries. These findings support refining surveillance guidelines and adaptation of risk stratification tools.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Research Communication: Teriflunomide Does Not Affect Gluten-Specific T-Cell Activity in Coeliac Disease-A Randomised, Placebo-Controlled Trial.\r\nThe main aim was to observe attenuation of gluten-specific T-cell activation markers after gluten exposure. We found no significant differences in T-cell activity between groups, concluding that teriflunomide is ineffective as a non-dietary treatment for coeliac disease.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Treatment-Free Outcomes Following Surgery for IBD: A Nationwide Cohort Study.\r\nSurgery obviated the need for future therapy in 22% of patients with CD and 42% with UC. Absence of extraintestinal manifestations, older age in UC, and longer disease duration and absence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in CD may highlight an opportunity for precision surgery to identify those most likely to achieve long-term benefit from surgical intervention.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Am J Gastroenterol\r\n    Comparative Safety of Advanced Therapies in Patients with Ulcerative Colitis: An Administrative Claims-based Study.\r\nIn a real-world cohort of patients with UC, anti-interleukins and JAK inhibitors were associated with lower risk of serious infections and may offer net benefit, especially in patients with prior TNF antagonist exposure.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Demodicosis Mimics Acneiform Eruptions in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease Receiving Upadacitinib: A Case Series.\r\nDemodicosis should be considered in patients with IBD having acneiform eruptions, particularly those receiving upadacitinib.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Effects of Screening Colonoscopy: Evidence From Observational and Interventional Studies.\r\nWe conclude that, despite apparent differences in reported results, both observational and interventional provide compelling evidence for strong preventive effects of screening colonoscopy. On the population level, similarly strong incidence and mortality reduction might be reached by well-organized screening programs achieving higher adherence rates with less invasive screening tests.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Impact of Artificial Intelligence Use on Endoscopist Optical Diagnosis of Sessile Serrated Lesions, Traditional Serrated Adenomas and Advanced Conventional Adenomas.\r\nCADx use did neither significantly harm nor improve optical diagnostic performance for SSLs despite CADx inability to classify SSLs.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Per-oral endoscopic myotomy-induced reduction of crural diaphragm contractility might contribute to development of post-procedural reflux esophagitis.\r\nPOEM can impair CD contraction, and weak CD contraction was associated with post-POEM RE.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx The Risk of Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\n While the risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy overall was not increased in pregnancies affected by IBD, there was an increased risk of preeclampsia. This may reflect underlying immune-mediated placental dysfunction.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx The impact of E-Cigarettes and Heat-Not-Burn Tobacco on Postoperative Recurrence of Crohn's Disease: A Multicenter International Study.\r\n HNBT, and possibly e-cigarettes, are associated with increased endoscopic recurrence of CD compared to non-smoking.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Utility of quantitative fecal immunochemical test values for average risk colorectal cancer screening risk stratification among patients with a positive test.\r\n Neoplastic findings occurred across the whole spectrum of qFIT values, emphasising the need for colonoscopy for al positive qFIT tests. However, increasing qFIT values correlated with the PPV for CRC and advanced adenoma and may help to stratify patients at highest risk for detecting serious neoplastic lesions in resource-constrained settings.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Recent Trends of Incidence, Mortality, Treatment, and Overall Survival of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in the United States.\r\n HCC incidence rates have started to decline, and incidence-based mortality has plateaued. Given lower early-stage detection and curative treatments during the COVID-19 pandemic, longer-term follow-up is warranted to assess the impact on survival. The reduced survival disparities between non-Hispanic Black and White patients may reflect improved equitable medical access.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Seroprevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection among asymptomatic patients served by a safety-net healthcare system.\r\n In this population-based study, almost two-thirds of asymptomatic patients were seropositive for H. pylori. Prevalence was over 40% among al sub-groups. Screening solely based on race and ethnicity may inadvertently exacerbate disparities by overlooking confounding factors for infection like low socioeconomic status and regional exposures.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Endoscopy\r\n    Individuals with polyps ≥10mm without other high-risk features have a similarly low post-colonoscopy colorectal cancer risk as those with no polyps.\r\nPCCRC-risk 5 years after baseline colonoscopy within individuals with polyps ≥10mm without other high-risk features is not significantly different from individuals without polyps at baseline. Lengthening surveillance intervals would affect 79% of high-risk individuals with ≥10mm polyps as their sole high-risk feature, and 46% if limited to those with 10-20mm polyps.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Intraductal Cryobiopsy via Percutaneous Cholangioscopy for Biliary Strictures: a Multicenter Feasibility Study.\r\nThis feasibility study showed that intraductal cryobiopsy via percutaneous cholangioscopy yielded larger samples and may enable more detailed histologic assessment than forceps biopsies. Further studies will evaluate its accuracy, safety, and potential for use with peroral cholangioscopy during ERCP.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Gastroenterology\r\n    Comparative Efficacy of Advanced Therapies for Management of Moderate-to-Severe Crohn's Disease: 2025 AGA Evidence Synthesis.\r\nUsing Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation to appraise quality of evidence, this updated network meta-analysis can inform positioning of advanced therapies for the treatment of biologic-naïve and biologic-exposed patients with moderate-to-severe CD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Intestinal LKB1 Loss Drives a Premalignant Program Along the Serrated Cancer Pathway.\r\nHeterozygous loss of LKB1 pushes intestinal cells into a chronic regenerative state, which is amplified on loss of heterozygosity. Lkb1 deficiency thereby generates fertile ground for serrated colorectal cancer formation in the intestine, potentially explaining the increased cancer risk observed in PJS.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Retraction Notice to: \"CSF1 Restores Innate Immunity After Liver Injury in Mice and Serum Levels Indicate Outcomes of Patients With Acute Liver Failure\" Gastroenterology 2015;149:1896-1909.e14.\r\nThe authors requested that this paper be retracted in 2019, and the Editors of Gastroenterology agree that this manuscript should be retracted. Dr Daniel Antoine played no part in any other aspects of this manuscript, and the authors have confidence in al other data.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Gastrointest Endosc\r\n    Best practices for Endoscopic Ultrasound-guided Gastroenterostomy: technical recommendations from an International modified Delphi process.\r\nDespite technical differences (such as the preference of a jejunal catheter or a double-balloon catheter) most EUS-GE experts agree on key technical principles, providing valuable guidance on the standardization of EUS-GE in clinical practice. Conversely, certain topics show limited agreement, identifying future research priorities in the field of EUS-GE.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Extended Surveillance After Piecemeal Endoscopic Mucosal Resection: A Safe Approach to Initial Surveillance in Low-Risk Patients.\r\n A risk-stratified approach may safely extend surveillance to 12 months for lower-risk patients following piecemeal EMR, reducing unnecessary procedures without compromising care.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Peroral cholangioscopy-guided laser-stricturoplasty for intrahepatic benign biliary strictures (with video).\r\n This pilot study suggests that POCS-LAS is a technically feasible and potentially effective treatment for intrahepatic BBS.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Gut\r\n    PDE5A<sup>+<\/sup> cancer-associated fibroblasts enhance immune suppression in gastric cancer.\r\nOur study elucidates the intricate role of PDE5A + CAFs in shaping the immunosuppressive TME in GC, providing mechanistic insights and therapeutic potential for combating this aggressive malignancy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx SMYD2-mediated methylation of STAT1 protects against hepatic ischaemia/reperfusion injury by blocking JAK-STAT1 signalling pathways.\r\n This study establishes SMYD2 as a novel negative regulator of STAT1 activity through K175 methylation, providing new insights into the epigenetic control of STAT1 during hepatic I/R injury. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognised mechanism for fine-tuning STAT1 signalling in hepatic I/R injury, and targeting the SMYD2-STAT1 axis may present a promising therapeutic strategy for mitigating I/R-associated liver damage.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx iPSC-induced multilineage liver organoids, small intestinal organoids and brain organoids sustain pangenotype hepatitis E virus propagation.\r\n This study established iPSC-induced multilineage organoid infection models, confirming HEV's capacity for pan-tissue infection and revealing potential pathogenic mechanisms in the liver, intestine and nervous system. This platform provides valuable tools for HEV virology research and antiviral drug development, underscoring the unique value of organoid technology in infectious disease research.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Hepatology\r\n    Glutamine synthetase loss in β-catenin-mutant hepatocellular carcinoma promotes tumor burden through macrophage metabolic reprogramming.\r\nWe demonstrate unique metabolic dependency of β-catenin-mutated HCCs on GS in tumor cells which is diverted to macrophages upon GS elimination in tumor cells. This adaptation alters macrophage metabolism and function leading to compromised immunosurveillance and greater tumor burden. Our study reveals a metabolic dynamic between HCC cells and macrophages with impact on tumor biology.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Hepatectomy alters adjuvant anti-PD-1 action in a mouse model of HCC but does not compromise neoadjuvant efficacy.\r\nPartial hepatectomy disrupts antitumor immunity and limits adjuvant ICI efficacy. Neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 immunotherapy offers a superior strategy compared to adjuvant immunotherapy in enhancing immune responses and reducing HCC recurrence.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx MSR1+ macrophages passivate antitumor immunity by inducing ITM2A+ CD4T exhaustion differentiation.\r\nMSR1+macrophages promote tumor-infiltrating ITM2A+CD4T exhaustion differentiation by regulating the ITM2A-ZAP70 axis. ZEA-αCD4 specifically targeted MSR1-ITM2A interaction to activate antitumor immunity and improve the efficacy of αPDL1 immunotherapy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Reclassifying pediatric NAFLD using the steatotic liver disease framework: a multicenter retrospective study from the NASH CRN.\r\nMost children with NAFLD met MASLD criteria, but nearly 1 in 6 were reclassified based on alcohol use or medication exposure. These findings highlight the need for a systematic diagnostic approach accounting for metabolic risk factors, alcohol use, and medication-related liver injury.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Serum bile acid levels predict the development of portal hypertension and high-risk esophageal varices following successful Kasai in biliary atresia.\r\n In biliary atresia patients with successful KP, sBA is an early biomarker predicting the development of PH and HRV within 5 years post-KP.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx J Hepatol\r\n    HBx-induced HSPB1 is a potential therapeutic target owing to its modulation of HBV cccDNA and hepatic immune responses.\r\nHSPB1 represents a novel therapeutic target by modulating HBV cccDNA and immune responses in the liver. D-TK is a promising clinical candidate for HBV treatment through cccDNA suppression and immune activation. Impact and implications Chronic infection with HBV remains a significant global health concern, and current therapeutic options are inadequate. In this study, we demonstrate that HBx-induced elevation of HSPB1 contributes to the regulation of HBV cccDNA and the hepatic immune responses. We engineered a peptide, D-TK, that targets HBx, effectively suppresses cccDNA, and activates immune responses through HSPB1. Our findings offer new insights into the mechanism by which HBx-induced HSPB1 modulates HBV cccDNA and immune regulation in the liver.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Microbial metabolism dysfunction induced by transarterial chemoembolization aggravates postprocedural liver injury in HCC.\r\nThis is the first study to identify gut microbiota disturbance, i.e., deficiency of L. reuteri metabolite ILA, as significant cause of TACE-LI. L. reuteri and ILA administration serves as promising therapeutic approach for TACE-LI, which is crucial for reducing TACE adverse effects to achieve better prognosis in HCC. Impact and implications The majority of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are diagnosed losing the chance of surgical resection. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is widely used for treating unresectable HCC;  however, its long-term outcome is significantly limited by its main complication, i.e., liver injury (LI). In addition to traditional cognition of the direct liver damage of the ischemic necrosis or regional chemotherapy induced by TACE, the deeper mechanisms underlying TACE-induced LI (TACE-LI) remain largely unclear. Gut microbiota can modulate various liver diseases but its exact role in TACE-LI has not been reported. We found that TACE could disturb the gut microbiota. This disturbance was characterized by reduced levels of Limosilactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) and its metabolite indole-3-lactic acid (ILA), which were correlated with aggravated TACE-LI and poor overall survival in HCC. Administration of L. reuteri or ILA significantly improved TACE-LI by inhibiting the inflammation of macrophages. Our study is the first report highlighting gut microbiota disturbances as an important cause of TACE-LI;  administration of L. reuteri or ILA represents a viable and secure strategy for preventing TACE-LI, thereby reducing the adverse effects of TACE and yielding better prognoses in patients with HCC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are

DSI is an excellent negative predictor, although not an independent risk factor. The NCCN/ESMO guideline has medium sensitivity and requires improvement. The JSCCR/FICPG guideline has perfect sensitivity but low specificity, thus exposing patients to many unnecessary surgeries. There is revision potential for current guideline factors, including those beyond current pathological ones, to improve LNM prediction accuracy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMCEndoscopy\r\n    Time trends in post-polypectomy surveillance guideline adherence: analysis of over 90 000 colonoscopies with polypectomy.\r\nAn improvement of up to 49% in ESGE guideline adherence was observed over 4 years after publication of the update, which was mostly driven by improved adherence to the surveillance intervals for adenomas. Endoscopists with higher ADRs were more likely to assign correct follow-up intervals.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx J Hepatol\r\n    Consensus position statements for the standardized application of histological grading and staging systems in MASH clinical trials.\r\n The IMPG statements provide for the first time guidelines to promote consensus among liver pathologists for the histopathological evaluation and scoring of liver biopsies for MASH clinical trials. Furthermore, they may be used to inform supervised machine learning algorithms for quantitative MASLD histology assessments. Impact and implications Inter- (and intra-) observer variations in the histological interpretation of key morphological features of MASH limit the precision of histological grading and staging as well as the diagnosis of the histological MASLD types, MASL and MASH. This is thought to account in clinical trials, at least in part, for screening failure as well as variable placebo response rates, potentially obscuring treatment effects. The International MASLD Pathology Group, consisting of 25 expert liver pathologists, generated consensus statements for histopathological procedures, technical aspects and histological criteria for the diagnosis of MASH, for grading disease activity and staging fibrosis. These may provide a basis for standardized histologic interpretation and the development of AI-based grading and staging algorithms for clinical trials of MASH.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx J Neurogastroenterol Motil\r\n    Treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome With Antispasmolytics in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Vietnam: A Delphi Expert Consensus Statement.\r\nAlthough antispasmolytics provide immediate symptom relief, their long-term effectiveness needs further investigations in Asian populations. Our findings may inform clinical decision-making and guideline updates.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\nMeta-analysis\r\nmeta-analyses and systematic reviews\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Meta-Analysis: Efficacy and Safety of Sequestrants for Bile Acid Diarrhoea.\r\nThis study quantifies the significant and rapid improvement in both stool consistency and frequency with BAS in patients with objective diagnosis of bile acid diarrhoea.

This study provides valuable insights to enhance the design of future MASH trials.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Gastrointest Endosc\r\n    Clinical Impact of Routine Esophagram after Peroral Endoscopic Myotomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.\r\n Esophageal leakage is a very uncommon AE after POEM. Routine esophagram rarely impacted immediate post-procedural care in asymptomatic patients. Selective imaging may result in higher diagnostic yield, improved cost-efficiency, and mitigate the risk of unwarranted additional testing due to incidental radiographic findings.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Underwater vs Traction-assisted ESD in Colorectal Lesions Underwater versus Traction-assisted Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection for Colorectal Lesions: A Network Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.\r\n UW-ESD and T-ESD are both effective and safe strategies for colorectal lesions resection;  however, UW-ESD is the only technique that has demonstrated superior dissection speed.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Biomarkers of Extracellular Matrix Remodelling Are Linked to Severity and Outcome of Advanced Chronic Liver Disease.\r\n ECM remodelling biomarkers reflect PH and disease severity in ACLD. Their prognostic value for disease progression is largely restricted to cACLD. Future studies should investigate whether repeated measurements improve risk stratification.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Clinical Trial: Rifaximin Versus Low FODMAP Diet in Irritable Bowel Syndrome.\r\n Rifaximin is as effective as LFD in treating IBS over 4 weeks. However, it provides faster symptom relief and higher treatment adherence, making it a practical alternative for symptom management.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Mild Endoscopic Disease Activity Is Associated With Adverse Outcomes Among Older Adults With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\nAmong older adults with prevalent IBD, mild endoscopic disease activity, as compared to endoscopic remission, was associated with increased odds of adverse IBD-specific and morbidity-related outcomes at 1 year, with this risk persisting for IBD-specific outcomes at 5 years. These findings highlight the importance of achieving endoscopic remission, which may confer both short- and longer-term benefits in this population.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Overall and Comparative Risk of Shingles With Advanced Therapies in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.\r\nJAK inhibitors were associated with 1.7-2.2-fold higher risk of shingles than other advanced therapies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Research Communication: An Observational Cohort Study on Risk of Ovarian Cancer in Women with Irritable Bowel Syndrome.\r\nSome women with symptoms of ovarian cancer may be misdiagnosed with IBS, although IBS is not causally linked to ovarian cancer.

Our findings support routine EGD screening of asymptomatic FA patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMCSocial Determinants of Health in Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease and All-Cause/Cause-Specific Mortality.\r\nThis US population-based study demonstrates that SDoH scores are dose-dependently associated with increased all-cause/cause-specific mortality among individuals with MASLD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Am J Gastroenterol\r\n    An organized fecal immunochemical test-based screening program impacts colorectal cancer early diagnosis and survival in the short term.\r\n Biennial FIT led to an increase in early diagnoses and improved survival, compared to no screening, in the short term after its introduction. A screening program that includes alternatives to FIT may increase population coverage and improve CRC outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Assessing the reliability of 12 vs 24 hour esophageal pH-impedance monitoring for gastro-esophageal reflux in infants.\r\nEach MII-pH was analyzed twice as full-time recording and in the first 12h, and data were compared. GERD was diagnosed if one of the following occurred: Number of GER episodes ≥100 in 24 hours;  proximal GER episodes >44 (acid) or 57 (non-acid);  Reflux index (percent time with pH 5 minutes were significantly different between the two, but the clinical significance of this observation is unclear.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Delayed Remission With Advanced Therapies Is Not Associated With Worse One-Year Outcomes In Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\nAbout one-sixth of patients achieved delayed remission by week 30. They had comparable one-year outcomes as early remitters. Identifying predictors of delayed remission could help prevent early therapy discontinuation without affecting long-term outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx One versus five days of octreotide infusion for acute esophageal variceal bleeding: a randomized controlled trial.\r\nFollowing successful endoscopic band ligation, the 1-day regimen of octreotide had a non-inferior effect compared to the standard 5-day regimen in the prevention of 5-day re-bleeding and exhibited no significant differences in the prevention of 6-week re-bleeding and all-cause mortality.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF PNEUMATIC BALLOON DILATION FOR PEDIATRIC ACHALASIA - A SINGLE-CENTER EXPERIENCE.\r\n PD is a safe, effective first-line treatment for pediatric achalasia.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Validation of Dried Blood Spot Immunoreactive Trypsinogen (DBS-IRT) as a Biomarker of Exocrine Pancreas Function in Children with Pancreas Disease.\r\nDBS-IRT was successfully validated as a biomarker of exocrine pancreas function which allows its use in clinical setting, in addition to fecal elastase to determine pancreas function.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Vonoprazan Improves Nocturnal Gastroesophageal Reflux Symptoms in Non-Erosive Reflux Disease.\r\n Our study suggests that vonoprazan leads to relief of nighttime heartburn in patients with heartburn and a normal endoscopy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    AI-ASSISTED CAPSULE ENDOSCOPY FOR DETECTION OF ULCERS AND EROSIONS IN CROHN'S DISEASE: A MULTICENTER VALIDATION STUDY.\r\nThe AI-assisted SBCE reading achieved superior diagnostic performance compared to SoC, with a substantial decrease in reading time.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Changes in HBcAg and HBsAg Expression Following Antiviral Therapy and Their Role in Outcome of Patients with Chronic Hepatitis B.\r\nNA-related inhibition of viral replication was associated with marked reduction in HBcAg expression in HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients but minimal changes in extent of HBsAg staining, likely reflecting HBsAg production from integrated HBV DNA.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Experienced Discrimination and Medical Mistrust Among Patients with Cirrhosis: Survey Results from a Multicenter Cohort.\r\n Experienced discrimination and medical mistrust are common among Black patients with cirrhosis. Addressing these factors may mitigate racial and ethnic inequities in care, reduce barriers to care and improve outcomes for patients with cirrhosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx From Pixels to Peristalsis: Comparing Achalasia Diagnosis with Artificial Intelligence to Expert Endoscopists.\r\n These results indicate that AI can leverage upper endoscopy videos to detect achalasia with an accuracy comparable to that of expert endoscopists.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Long-Term Glycemic Control and the Risk of Liver Stiffness Progression and Liver-Related Events in MASLD.\r\nT2D was independently associated with a higher risk of liver stiffness progression and LRE in MASLD. Good glycemic control was associated with slower liver stiffness progression, but not regression or LRE.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Long-term safety of vedolizumab in patients with ulcerative colitis/Crohn's disease: A prospective observational study.\r\n There was no new safety signal identified in relation to vedolizumab. Results regarding safety and effectiveness were consistent with the known profile of vedolizumab.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Seroprevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection among asymptomatic patients served by a safety-net healthcare system.\r\n In this population-based study, almost two-thirds of asymptomatic patients were seropositive for H. pylori.

Inhibiting Caspase-1 may provide a novel therapeutic approach to mitigate endothelial dysfunction in CLD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx MSR1+ macrophages passivate antitumor immunity by inducing ITM2A+ CD4T exhaustion differentiation.\r\nMSR1+macrophages promote tumor-infiltrating ITM2A+CD4T exhaustion differentiation by regulating the ITM2A-ZAP70 axis. ZEA-αCD4 specifically targeted MSR1-ITM2A interaction to activate antitumor immunity and improve the efficacy of αPDL1 immunotherapy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Reclassifying pediatric NAFLD using the steatotic liver disease framework: a multicenter retrospective study from the NASH CRN.\r\nMost children with NAFLD met MASLD criteria, but nearly 1 in 6 were reclassified based on alcohol use or medication exposure. These findings highlight the need for a systematic diagnostic approach accounting for metabolic risk factors, alcohol use, and medication-related liver injury.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Sex and body size disparities under MELD 3.0: Evaluation of persisting gaps in liver transplant access.\r\n MELD3.0 led to early gains in transplant access for women, though this effect diminished over time and differences by sex mediated by body size persisted.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx J Hepatol\r\n    Early portopulmonary hypertension predicts mortality in patients with cirrhosis: insights from the PORTO-DETECT cohort.\r\n Applying the 2022 ESC/ERC definitions of PAH identifies a subset of patients with cirrhosis with early-stage PoPH, characterized by mild pulmonary vascular resistance elevation, who nevertheless face a markedly increased risk of death, emphasizing the need for systematic screening and early targeted intervention. Impact and implications Portopulmonary hypertension (PoPH) is a severe and often overlooked complication of cirrhosis. Using the updated 2022 ESC/ERS diagnostic criteria, this multicenter study identified a previously unrecognized subgroup of cirrhotic patients with early-stage PoPH, defined by mildly elevated pulmonary vascular resistance and mean pulmonary artery pressure. Despite their subtle hemodynamic changes, these patients showed significantly reduced survival, independent of liver disease severity. These results highlight the prognostic relevance of early PoPH and suggest that applying the new criteria may help refine risk stratification and guide closer follow-up or earlier consideration of targeted interventions in selected patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Genetically engineered pig-to-human liver xenotransplantation.\r\nThis study demonstrates the feasibility of auxiliary porcine liver xenotransplantation as a bridging approach to human to liver transplantation. Postoperative xTMA presents a significant challenge to long-term success, highlighting the need for further research to improve xenotransplantation outcomes. Impact and implications This study reports the world's first auxiliary xenotransplantation from a 10-gene-edited pig to a living human recipient - distinct from previous studies involving brain-dead donors. The donor liver was engineered using a 10-gene editing platform, including the knockout of xenoantigen genes and the knock-in of seven human transgenes for immune and coagulation compatibility - pushing the boundaries of synthetic biology in clinical transplantation. The porcine graft exhibited metabolically active liver function, bile secretion, and coagulation correction, demonstrating not only survival but clinically meaningful function. Our work documents, for the first time, xenotransplantation-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (xTMA) in a living human recipient, with comprehensive immunological and histopathological analysis - critical knowledge for the field.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx J Neurogastroenterol Motil\r\n    Age- and Sex-dependent Effects of High-fructose, High-fat Diets on Small Bowel Inflammation and Hepatic Steatosis in F344 Rats.\r\nLiver and small bowel tissues were histologically analyzed.

These findings highlight RETN + monocytes and Resistin as promising immunotherapeutic targets for HBV-ACLF.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Hepatology\r\n    Association between longitudinal weight change and clinical outcome in individuals with MASLD.\r\nIn MASLD, weight gain is associated with increased LREs risks and liver stiffness progression. Conversely, weight loss confers benefits for liver stiffness improvement and modifies LREs risk in those who achieve obesity reversal.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Hepatocyte-derived extracellular vesicles promote endothelial dedifferentiation in chronic liver disease through the miR-153-3p - pyroptosis axis.\r\nHepEVs-derived miRNAs, particularly miR-153-3p, contribute to endothelial dysfunction in CLD by triggering pyroptosis through a paracrine mechanism. Inhibiting Caspase-1 may provide a novel therapeutic approach to mitigate endothelial dysfunction in CLD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Laser-activated nanoparticles rewire tumor microenvironment enhancing PD-1 blockade and T cell response in cholangiocarcinoma.\r\nOur findings emphasize the therapeutic potential of combining nanotechnology and immunotherapy to reshape the TME and overcome immunotherapy resistance in fibrotic tumors, such as CCA. Targeting both ECM and immune checkpoints has emerged as a promising and versatile strategy to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy against desmoplastic cancers.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Pioneering precision: The evolution of immunotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma.\r\nIn addition, several novel immunotherapeutic targets have been identified and treatments exploiting those targets are currently at early as well as late stages of clinical development. Herein, we review this evolution of immunotherapy for HCC which holds the potential for increasing therapeutic precision and thus for maximizing the benefit of patients while simultaneously reducing their risk of harm.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Sarcoid liver disease - A review article.\r\nPatients with ongoing hepatic inflammation require the initiation of the disease-modifying agents to prevent fibrosis and decompensation. This review article summarizes the existing literature on etiology, risk factors, pathogenesis, clinical features, and the management of hepatic sarcoid.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Targeting sterol O-acyltransferase 1 rewires fatty acid metabolism and uncovers immune vulnerability in hepatocellular carcinoma.\r\n SOAT1 functions as both a metabolic vulnerability and an immune regulator in HCC. Its inhibition disrupts tumor-promoting metabolic processes while enhancing immune activation, presenting it as a promising therapeutic target. Combining SOAT1 inhibition with PD-1 blockade holds potential for improving outcomes in HCC immunotherapy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx J Hepatol\r\n    HES V2.0 validation and performance compared to GALAD and ASAP in the HEDS cohort.\r\nIn a phase 3 biomarker validation study, HES V2.0 had higher sensitivity than ASAP for HCC detection, and a similar or higher sensitivity than GALAD only at 12 months before HCC diagnosis at 10% FPR and when over time gradients in AFP, AFP L3, and DCP are available. Impact and implications Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, with early detection being critical for improving survival outcomes. This study provides a rigorous phase 3 validation of the HES V2.0 biomarker panel, demonstrating its superior or comparable sensitivity to established models like GALAD and ASAP in a large, diverse U.S. cirrhosis cohort. The findings are particularly impactful for clinicians and researchers focused on liver cancer surveillance, as HES V2.0 offers enhanced detection performance, especially when longitudinal biomarker data are available. These results support the integration of HES V2.0 into clinical workflows and future trials, potentially improving early HCC detection and enabling timely curative interventions for at-risk patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Multicenter phase II trial of lenvatinib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma after progression on first-line atezolizumab plus bevacizumab.\r\nLenvatinib demonstrated promising efficacy and a manageable safety profile as a second-line treatment for patients with HCC progressing on atezo-bev. These findings offer prospective evidence supporting lenvatinib as a viable treatment option in the post-atezo-bev context. Impact and implications This study provides the first prospective evidence for the use of lenvatinib as a second-line therapy for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma who have progressed after first-line atezo-bev treatment. The findings highlight the potential of lenvatinib as a viable therapeutic option in a clinical setting where few alternatives are available. The results are particularly important for healthcare professionals managing unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, as they provide a robust framework for considering lenvatinib in second-line treatment protocols. Given the manageable safety profile, these findings could be translated into practical recommendations for clinical practice, offering physicians a treatment strategy to improve patient outcomes following atezo-bev failure while guiding future research into combination therapies and broader patient populations. Clinical trial number NCT06138769.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Prognostic value of liver stiffness measurement vs. biochemical response in primary biliary cholangitis.\r\nDiscordance between LSM and biochemical response is frequent. Most recent or current LSM is the strongest predictor of first liver-related events in patients with PBC, irrespective of prior biochemical response or LSM trajectory. Impact and implications Both liver stiffness measurement (LSM) and biochemical response have prognostic significance in patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). However, the clinical relevance and how discordant biochemical and LSM changes should be best interpreted remain unclear. In this large international multicenter study, we demonstrated that once the current LSM (LSMc) is known, prior LSM trajectories and biochemical changes did not improve the prediction of liver-related events in patients with PBC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Reversal of ACLF and ALF using whole blood extracorporeal system combining HLA-depleted liver organoids with granulocyte-monocyte apheresis.\r\nThe tandem UTOpiA circuit provides a significant survival benefit in preclinical rodent models of ACLF and ALF by providing anti-inflammatory, synthetic, and metabolic support. Understanding the regenerative signals that promote recovery of the injured liver will broaden the scope of this whole blood extracorporeal system, potentially serving as a new off-the-shelf liver support therapy. Impact and implications Restoring hepatic metabolism while controlling inflammation in acutely decompensated cirrhosis, is a major clinical unmet need. Combining human HLA-modified human iPSC derived liver organoids with granulocyte and monocyte apheresis, we report a bioartificial liver system to manage inflammation, restore liver function and augment regenerqation in two rat models of severe liver failure. This therapy could offer a off-the-shelf therapeutic option for patients with life-threatening liver failure.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Targeting cell-state plasticity driven by FOXM1/CEBPB axis disrupts developmental heterogeneity and therapeutic resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma.\r\n Tumor cell-state plasticity driven by the FOXM1/CEBPB axis induces developmental heterogeneity and therapeutic resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma. RNAi-based therapies targeting hepatic FOXM1 showed strong potential for further clinical testing. Impact and implications Tumor heterogeneity and therapeutic resistance remain major barriers in cancer treatment, largely driven by dynamic transitions across multiple cellular states. This study reveals that the FOXM1/CEBPB axis is a crucial regulator of these hierarchical cellular transitions and plays a key role in sustaining developmental heterogeneity and promoting resistance to therapies. By targeting this axis, we demonstrated the restoration of developmental homogeneity and significant disruption of therapeutic resistance in preclinical models. Furthermore, our findings highlight the strong efficacy of RNAi-based therapeutics directed at hepatic FOXM1, highlighting their promising potential as pioneering small nucleic acid drugs for cancer therapy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Transcriptomic and epigenetic mechanisms controlling cholangiocytes transdifferentiation into hepatocytes.\r\nOverall, our results confirm that cholangiocytes can transdifferentiate into hepatocytes. This process is promoted by HNF4G, it involves epigenetic remodelling, and is consistent across the three liver lobes. This knowledge paves the way for future therapies aiming to enhance liver regeneration by increasing cholangiocytes' plasticity.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Significance of Neoplasia Detection Rate in Barrett's Esophagus: A \"PEEC\" into the Data and Optimal Definitions.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Gastroenterology\r\n    Foundation Models in Medicine, Gastroenterology, and Endoscopy: The Next Frontier?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx In Memoriam: Jaume Bosch, MD, PhD.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Gut\r\n    Current and emerging concepts for systemic treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer.\r\nThese findings open new avenues for the development of advanced immunotherapies for CRC. In this review, we summarise major developments in the systemic therapy of CRC within the last couple of decades, provide an overview of emerging and soon-to-be implemented therapeutic strategies and present concepts from clinical and preclinical research to manipulate tumour cells and the tumour stroma to sensitise microsatellite stable colorectal tumours to immunotherapy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Rise of precision medicine: can it deliver on its promise in IBD?\r\nIn this concept, longitudinal assessment of patient-reported outcomes and molecular profiling in response to therapy may serve as early predictors of long-term outcomes, guide early therapeutic adjustments and reveal mechanisms that open new therapeutic avenues, such as adjunct or combination treatments. Adopting this dynamic, data-driven approach to treatment adaptation could shift management of IBD from reactive to proactive and substantially improve long-term outcomes with the vision to fully control a life-long disease.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx J Hepatol\r\n    Postnatal hepatocyte proliferation - challenge and opportunity for gene therapy.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Rat

The PAGE-B score can be used to stratify HCC risk in this population, with negligible 5-year HCC incidence in those without cirrhosis and low PAGE-B scores. However, caution should be exercised in patients with cirrhosis in whom HCC risk remains significant even among those with a low PAGE-B score.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nResearch Communication: Combination Therapy of Upadacitinib With Infliximab, Risankizumab, Ustekinumab or Vedolizumab for Refractory Crohn's Disease: A Descriptive Case Series.\r\nAdverse events occurred in 13 patients, leading to treatment discontinuation in three. Combining upadacitinib with a biologic appeared effective and safe, warranting further investigation in prospective studies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Defining non-invasive criteria for indicating drug therapy in metabolic-associated steatotic liver disease in clinical practice.\r\n The diagnostic performance and reliability of the proposed non-invasive criteria for initiating resmetirom treatment were suboptimal.About the half of patients with indication would not receive treatment under these criteria.A new strategy, using FIB-4, the presence of diabetes and overweight, and liver stiffness improved the identification of MASLD patients with fibrosis stage 2-3.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEffectiveness and Safety of Orodispersible Budesonide for Eosinophilic Esophagitis: A Multicenter Real-World Study.\r\n Our real-world data confirm that BOTs are effective in inducing clinical and histologic remission in most EoE patients. The drug has a good safety profile, with side effects occurring only in a small number of patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInfliximab and ustekinumab clearance better predict endoscopic outcomes than trough concentrations in Crohn's disease.\r\nMethods Data from patients with moderate-to-severe CD starting infliximab (n=108) and ustekinumab (n=80) therapy were repurposed. Endoscopic remission (CD Endoscopic Index of Severity loses its ability to predict treatment response when doses are optimized or not administered by bodyweight, infliximab and ustekinumab clearance remain a reliable predictor for endoscopic outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReal-world use of terlipressin in cirrhosis and acute kidney injury: frequent use beyond hepatorenal syndrome.\r\nTerlipressin is often used for treatment of AKI outside its primary indication of HRS-AKI. Compared to patients with HRS-AKI, response to terlipressin is significantly lower in patients with ATN, in whom the risks may outweigh the benefits. Respiratory failure is common, but does not seem to be driven by the amount of albumin received nor ACLF grade.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReliability and Responsiveness of Endoscopic Indices for Assessing Crohn's Disease Postoperative Recurrence in the PREVENT trial.\r\n Existing endoscopic indices are reliable and responsive for assessing postoperative CD activity in the neoterminal ileum, although are suboptimal for evaluation in the anastomosis or distal colonic segment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSocioeconomic disparity and risk of irritable bowel syndrome: a cohort study with mediation analysis.\r\nHigher SES is associated with reduced risk of incident IBS with mediation effect of healthy lifestyle factors.

Therefore, SAP may be appropriate for the prevention of post-ESD bleeding in the colon.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP OF PATIENTS UNDERGOING CHOLANGIOPANCREATOSCOPY-GUIDED LASER DISSECTION AND ABLATION FOR REFRACTORY PANCREATIC AND BILIARY STRICTURES.\r\nCPL has high technical success and an acceptable safety profile for the treatment of benign refractory BD and PD strictures.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    Fructose drives colorectal cancer progression by regulating crosstalk between cancer-associated fibroblasts and tumour cells.\r\nThese findings reveal a novel mechanism by which fructose fosters tumour progression through the modulation of tumour-stroma interactions, and highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting fructose metabolism in CRC to disrupt the tumour-stroma crosstalk that drives malignancy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    Efficacious suppression of primary and metastasized liver tumors by polyIC-loaded lipid nanoparticles.\r\n Contrary to our original goal, we unexpectedly found that polyIC-LNPs function as an efficacious monotherapy tailored for liver cancer, capable of coordinately modulating antitumor immunity. This novel approach eliminates the need for ICIs, thereby addressing key limitations of current immunotherapies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIL1β Signaling Mediates the Interaction Between Hepatitis B and C Viruses.\r\nOur findings reveal a macrophage-derived, IFN-independent mechanism by which HCV suppresses HBV infection, mediated through IL1β. These insights highlight the complex crosstalk between hepatotropic viruses during coinfection and suggest that targeting IL1β-regulated pathways may offer therapeutic potential to prevent HBV reactivation in DAA-treated patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNatural history and development of a novel composite endpoint in patients with alcohol-associated Hepatitis: Data from a prospective multicenter study.\r\n This large observational study showed a high incidence of composite liver and alcohol-use events within six months, reiterating the need for early interventions.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    S1P/S1PR4 Promotes the Differentiation of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> tissue-resident memory T Cells Aggravating Bile Duct Injury in Biliary Atresia.\r\nThe S1 subtype of BA, characterized by dysregulated immune pathways and poor prognosis, was identified. S1P/S1PR4 signaling promotes cholangiocyte injury via promoting CX3CR1 + CD8 + Teff migration and their differentiation into apoptosis-inducing CD8 + TRM cells. Impact and implications Our study bridges a critical knowledge gap in biliary atresia (BA) pathogenesis by defining how sphingolipid-driven CD8 + TRM differentiation via S1P/S1PR4 signaling exacerbates bile duct injury, establishing the mechanistic link between immunometabolic dysregulation and BA progression. These findings are essential for pediatric hepatologists and immunologists, as they identify the S1 molecular subtype (characterized by poor prognosis and immune hyperactivation) as a high-risk population warranting precision intervention. For patients, S1PR4 inhibition (CYM50358) experimentally reduces biliary obstruction and improves survival in BA mouse models, supporting its prioritization for clinical trials especially in S1-subtype BA.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided
