(UMIN000013177).\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx MELD-Lactate and lactate clearance in critically ill cirrhosis patients with sepsis.\n Early reduction in initial LA by one-third predicts 30-day mortality and may indicate treatment response in cirrhosis patients with sepsis in the ICU. Combining MELD-LA and LA clearance early enables better risk stratification and informs management.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Optimal Single or Combined Parameters for Dyssynergic Defecation on Anorectal Manometry: A Proof-of-Concept Machine Learning Study.\nTwo-hundred and twenty-two (72.3%) patients had a clinical diagnosis of DD. Compared to patients without clinical diagnosis of DD, patients with DD had significantly lower rectoanal pressure gradient (RAG) (median -34.7 [IQR -57.1, -13.0] vs -24.6 [IQR -44.5, -2.4] mmHg, p=0.009) and more abnormal BET (59.5% vs 11.8%, p 80% PPV for diagnosing DD in patients with chronic constipation.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol\n    6-Mercaptopurine vs. Mycophenolate Mofetil in Autoimmune Hepatitis and Azathioprine Intolerance: A Multicenter Study.\nBoth 6-MP and MMF were capable of maintaining biochemical response in patients with AIH who were intolerant to AZA, with no clear evidence of inferiority of either treatment. While MMF was generally better tolerated, 6-MP may present a safe and effective treatment option in women of reproductive age. In addition, therapy with 6-MP enables clinicians to monitor drug metabolite levels, titrate dosages, and monitor adherence.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Endosc Int Open\n    Characteristics and causes of post-endoscopy Barrett's neoplasia: Retrospective multicenter study.\nPEBN occurring in LSBE was mostly overlooked because of inadequate observation, whereas PEBN at the 0 to 3 o'clock position in SSBE was frequently misdiagnosed as esophagitis. Bearing these results in mind may improve quality of endoscopic screening and reduce incidence of PEBN.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMCEndoscopic submucosal dissection for early gastric cancer in the elderly: Spanish multicenter prospective study during initial experience.\nOctogenarians with EGC benefit from ESD in a Western setting in terms of disease-free survival, but have lower long-term survival due to comorbidities, underscoring the importance of pre-procedure risk assessment. ESD is a proven safe technique, but in the subgroup of patients aged ≥ 80 years with severe comorbidities (ASA-PS ≥ IV), periprocedural mortality is increased and the indication should be carefully evaluated.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMCEndoscopic ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation for large branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms: Safety and efficacy trial.\nEUS-RFA in large, predominantly multilocular BD-IPMNs shows promising volumetric efficacy. Safety may be improved through refined energy delivery and technical advances. Molecular response remains exploratory and requires further validation. Long-term studies assessing progression-free outcomes are needed to define its role as an organ-preserving therapeutic option.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMCPredictors of non-compliance with post-procedure follow-up after endoscopic stent placement.\nPatient-specific risk factors for non-compliance of stent removal were identified. Patients with such risk factors may require extra education and communication efforts.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMCWhich patients with palliative malignant biliary obstruction will benefit most from biliary drainage: Development and validation of a prognostic score.\nThis score could be used in routine clinical practice to identify patients who have better survival outcomes after biliary drainage in palliative MBO.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMCEndoscopy\n    Robot-Assisted Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography: A Pilot Study.\n Despite the need for cautious interpretation in this limited cohort, our initial outcomes support the procedural feasibility of the robotic system and hint at its potential to assist in ERCP, but must be confirmed in larger studies.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Gastrointest Endosc\n    Diagnostic value of magnifying endoscopy for colorectal laterally spreading tumor non-granular type.\nMagnifying endoscopy has limited utility in therapeutic decision-making for LST-NG, particularly for PD lesions, indicating the importance of en bloc endoscopic resection whenever technically feasible, regardless of magnifying endoscopic findings.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Endoscopic Ultrasound-Guided Coils Embolization with Cyanoacrylate Injection versus Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt with Variceal Embolization for Gastric Variceal Bleeding: A Multicenter Propensity-Matched Analysis.\n EUS-Coils+CYA and TIPS+VE showed comparable outcomes in controlling GV rebleeding and survival.

Targeting the NSUN6-CCL2 axis represents a promising strategy to sensitise PDAC to ICB therapy.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Hepatology\n    Genomic and transcriptomic profiling of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with Fontan-associated liver disease.\nGenomic mutational profiles of FALD and non-Fontan CHS HCCs are distinct from HCCs with other etiologies. Copy number alterations and transcriptional profiles in FALD HCCs classified these into a poor-prognosis group of HCCs.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Stroma-driven inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity of PD-L1 expression in cholangiocarcinoma: Implications for biomarker development and prognostic evaluation.\n Our data indicate that stroma content may be a surrogate for inflamed iCCA. Moreover, the inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity of iCCA poses a significant challenge to interpreting the PD-L1 signal. To establish tissue-based biomarkers in iCCA, a more granular annotation of their expression in different intratumoral compartments will be critical.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx J Hepatol\n    A single-cell atlas of the woodchuck liver reveals cellular programs conserved in human HBV infection.\nWe present a multi-omic atlas of healthy, diseased, and ex vivo-stimulated woodchuck liver. This work identified shared WHV-HBV pathological processes, reinforces the value of this preclinical model and provides a resource to advance HBV pathogenesis studies and therapeutic development. Impact and implications Limited treatment options for liver disease, often requiring liver transplantation, emphasize the need for human-relevant animal models to speed the development of new therapeutic interventions. Woodchucks infected with woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) develop chronic hepatitis and liver cancer, similar to human hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. However, the composition and active biological processes in woodchuck hepatic cells were poorly understood, limiting the utility of this model to therapeutic discovery. In this study, we characterized the healthy and chronically infected woodchuck liver in comparison to human HBV at a single-cell resolution reinforcing the potential of WHV-infected woodchuck as a model for human HBV disease.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx AF6 knockout-induced upregulation of bile acid production promotes CXCL14-mediated antitumor immunity in HCC: Effect of the BA/Butyrate/CXCL14 axis in HCC.\nAF6 modulates primary BA synthesis, driving gut microbiota-dependent butyrate production and Cxcl14-mediated immune remodeling in HCC. This axis highlights a novel mechanism linking BA metabolism, gut microbiota, and immune regulation, offering potential therapeutic targets for liver cancer treatment. Impact and implications This study establishes that hepatic Af6 deficiency restrains hepatocarcinogenesis via a BA-driven, microbiota-dependent butyrate-CXCL14 axis. This axis highlights a novel mechanism linking BA metabolism, gut microbiota, and immune regulation, providing potential therapeutic targets for liver cancer treatment. This research represents the first mouse model in which induces the generation of primary BAs is potentiated without associated alterations in the typical epithelial morphology. We expect that this model will be of use in monitoring BA-related pathological processes in the gastrointestinal tract, including cancer progression.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Incidence and implications of abstinence-induced recompensation in alcohol-related cirrhosis.\nAlcohol abstinence enabled recompensation in one third of patients with decompensated alcohol-related cirrhosis, particularly with early abstinence and absence of further decompensation. Recompensation led to a significant survival benefit with maintained abstinence, with a negligible residual risk of liver-related death and HCC. Impact and implications Hepatic recompensation, as defined by Baveno VII, is a novel clinical concept reflecting the potential for disease regression and resolution of decompensating events in patients with cirrhosis once the underlying aetiological factor is removed or controlled. In this multicentre study, sustained alcohol abstinence led to recompensation in one third of patients with decompensated alcohol-related cirrhosis within 5 years, particularly if abstinence was achieved early and in the absence of further decompensation. Recompensation markedly improved outcomes, with a negligible residual risk of liver-related death and hepatocellular carcinoma when abstinence is maintained. These findings support personalised treatment approaches in decompensated alcohol-related cirrhosis by helping identify patients at risk of progression or with potential for regression.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Updated data from IMbrave050: Adjuvant atezolizumab plus bevacizumab for high-risk hepatocellular carcinoma.\nIn this updated analysis, the initial RFS benefit seen with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab vs active surveillance was not sustained and OS remained immature. The safety profile of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab remained manageable and consistent with that of each agent and the underlying disease. Overall, the benefit-risk profile does not support atezolizumab plus bevacizumab as adjuvant therapy. Clinical trial number NCT04102098 IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS  Based on results from the IMbrave150 trial, atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab is the standard-of-care first-line treatment for unresectable HCC, prompting interest in investigating the combination in earlier treatment settings. IMbrave050 was the first immunotherapy study to report data in the adjuvant setting for HCC, where an early RFS benefit was observed at the pre-specified interim analysis but not maintained with longer follow-up;  overall survival remained immature. The updated results of IMbrave050 do not support the use of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab in the adjuvant setting. However, subgroup analyses suggest a potential benefit in select patients, warranting further prospective evaluation. Effective perioperative or adjuvant treatment remains a major unmet need for patients with HCC given the high rate of early post-operative relapse.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Yttrium-90 radioembolization is associated with a lower risk of liver transplant waitlist dropout than chemoembolization in hepatocellular carcinoma.\nIn a large national cohort of liver transplant candidates with HCC, TARE compared to TACE as first LRT was associated with higher rates of complete necrosis on explant, lower likelihood of multiple LRTs, and lower risk of waitlist dropout. Impact and implications With nearly al hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients in the US now receiving local regional therapies (LRT), better understanding of the optimal LRT type to achieve tumor control and maintain tumor stage is needed. In this contemporary study of over 5000 patients using the US national database (UNOS), we showed that trans-arterial radioembolization (TARE) may be the preferred bridging therapy over chemoembolization (TACE) based on a significantly lower probability of waitlist dropout after controlling for liver function and tumor characteristics. Additionally, TARE treated patients demonstrated higher probability of complete pathologic response and reduced tumor under-staging on explant, which taken together strongly suggests that TARE is a more effective tumor treatment compared to TACE.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \n\n\nReviews&Editorials\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\npublisher website using the provided link\n\n\n    Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol\n    Blue Notes.\n\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Knowledge, Attitudes, and Environment Related to Gastroenterology and Hepatology Care for Sexual and Gender Minorities.\n\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Gut\n    Shaping the future of postoperative recurrence in Crohn's disease: personalised approaches with AI-enabled imaging and multi-omics.\nWhile promising, these innovations require prospective validation, methodological standardisation and integration into clinical workflows before translation into routine practice.

Impacts and implications HBV sequence polymorphisms can lead to antiviral resistance for the treatment of chronic HBV infection. Therefore, it is important for HCPs to understand the prevalence and development of bepirovirsen binding site SNPs and how their presence in patients with chronic HBV infection may impact the virological response to bepirovirsen treatment. The Phase 2b clinical study findings reported here show that the large majority (92%) of non-responders, partial responders or relapsers did not have bepirovirsen binding site SNPs. Those with bepirovirsen binding site SNPs (7% of participants) still achieved HBsAg reductions, indicating that there is no need at this stage to test for specific HBV variants when administering bepirovirsen, and that treatment resistance via a change in sequence complementarity may be minimal and likely multifactorial. Additional data from ongoing Phase 3 studies of bepirovirsen will provide additional context for assessing this need, and for understanding potential mechanisms of resistance to bepirovirsen.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \n\n\nReviews&Editorials\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\npublisher website using the provided link\n\n\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\n    Editorial: Linking Patients With Cirrhosis to Clinical Care-The Hurdles and Way Forward.\n\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Editorial: TIPS in the Era of Aging and Metabolic Comorbidity: Rethinking Risks and Rewards.\n\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Review Article: Classic Bismuth Quadruple Therapy for Helicobacter pylori Infection-Questions Focused on Clinical Practice.\nBQT remains the most effective, safe, and practical regimen for H. pylori eradication, ensuring high cure rates across diverse resistance patterns and clinical settings.

Randomized trials are needed to compare traditional MAP targets (60-65 mm Hg) with intermediate targets (70-75 mm Hg) to improve outcomes in this high-risk population.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Clinical Trial Endpoints for Perianal Fistulizing Crohn's Disease.\nBased on our evaluation, future trials should use co-primary clinical and radiologic assessments to capture both how the patient feels and an objective measure of disease activity. These findings reinforce the need for clearly defined, objective, and standardized endpoints for pCD clinical trials that will enable evaluation of novel therapies to improve patient outcomes.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Comparative Outcomes of Flexible Endoscopy, Rigid Endoscopy, and Open Surgery for Zenker's Diverticulum Repair: A Retrospective Matched Cohort Study.\n In this matched cohort, FE has clinical success comparable to OS and superior to RE for ZD repair, with shorter hospital stays, reduced procedure lengths, and a trend toward fewer adverse events. Our matched, multi-center design provides stronger comparative evidence than prior unmatched studies. These findings support FE as a first-line treatment for ZD repair, though prospective studies could further clarify long-term outcomes.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Postimaging Colorectal Cancer After Computed Tomography Colonography: A Danish Nationwide Study.\n We found a higher overall PICRC-3y-rate than previously reported. The overall PICRC-3y-rate was also higher than reported 3-year rates for postcolonoscopy CRCs.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Resection depth of underwater versus conventional endoscopic mucosal resection for intermediate-sized colorectal tumors.\n UEMR achieved a resection depth comparable to that of CEMR. Given its consistent negative horizontal margins, UEMR may become the gold standard for resecting intermediate-sized colorectal tumors.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx The Enterolimbic axis: gut-brain affective circuits at the crossroad of metabolism, emotion, and behavior.\nWe propose that gastroenterologists embrace these agents as first-line therapies, leveraging the unique endocrine role of the gut in metabolic regulation. This review integrates molecular, clinical, and therapeutic insights to outline diagnostic and precision-medicine opportunities arising from enterolimbic modulation.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx The Time-Dependent Association Between Irritable Bowel Syndrome and All-Cause and Cause-Specific Mortality in the NIH-AARP Cohort Study.\n We found time-dependent inverse associations between IBS and all-cause, cancer and cardiovascular disease mortality. Although this association seemed to be strongly confounded by personal health advocacy/healthcare access during very short follow-up, further research is needed to explore the factors contributing to these associations observed after longer follow-up.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx The Utility of MUC2 and CDX2 Expression in the Diagnosis of Barrett's Esophagus: A Community-based Study of Wide-Area Transepithelial Sampling and Forceps Biopsies.\nMUC2 immunohistochemistry may be more sensitive and specific for diagnosing BE than goblet cells by FB.

Data did not support adding accessory symptoms to the construct, due to low loading or poor model fit.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \n\n\nReviews&Editorials\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\npublisher website using the provided link\n\n\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\n    Editorial: Decoding Gut Failure in Cirrhosis: Villin-1 and the Emergence of a Seventh Organ Failure.\n\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Editorial: Dysfunctional Neutrophils in Cirrhosis With Acute Decompensation: Why It Matters.\n\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol\n    Is it Time to Treat to Histologic Remission Yet?\n\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Gastroenterology\n    Emerging Diagnostic Indications for Endoscopic Ultrasound.\nFinally, EUS-obtained tissue now seeds organoids, patient-derived xenografts, and organotypic slice cultures to test individualized therapies. Collectively, these innovations move EUS beyond \"see and biopsy\" toward detect, predict, and personalize.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Gut\n    Combination therapies for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis: challenges and opportunities.\nThis review integrates current knowledge on multitargeted and combination therapies for MASH, examines mechanistic rationales and emerging clinical evidence and addresses practical considerations for patient-centred implementation. Therefore, we aim to provide clinicians and researchers with a comprehensive framework to optimise individualised management and improve both hepatic and systemic outcomes in individuals living with MASH.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Road to IBD prevention in the Global South: a conceptual framework modelling from non-communicable diseases.\nTherefore, in this review, we advocate for an alternative approach of combining evidence-based IBD prevention strategies with the time-tested strategies of NCD prevention approaches already being implemented. We suggest a sieving strategy for selecting preventive measures through a series of sieves-interventions that have evidence to support prevention, align with NCD prevention and are economically viable.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx J Neurogastroenterol Motil\n    Expanding the Physiological Role of the Endoluminal Functional Lumen Imaging Probe From the Esophagus to Pediatric Pylorus.\n\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Is Mean Basal Esophagogastric Junction Pressure a Simpler and More Reliable Marker for Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Barrier Function?\n\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Neural Gastric Electrical Stimulation: Future Prospects in Managing Gastric Emptying Disorders.\nThis review examines the evolution and implementation of NGES, focusing on its potential role as a treatment option to enhance gastric propulsion in gastroparesis and delayed gastric conduit emptying. While initial acute animal studies have shown promising results, continued development of the technology and refinement of stimulation protocols through chronic experiments remains essential for successful clinical translation.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \n\n\nMiscellaneous\nmisc publications eg case reports, tools of the trade, images of\nthe month, etc…\n\n\n    Am J Gastroenterol\n    ACG
