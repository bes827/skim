This review will discuss the immunogenomics of cholangiocarcinoma, including the impact of genomic alterations on immune functionality, subversion of the cancer-immunity cycle, as well as clinical implications for existing and novel treatment strategies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMicroRNA-206-3p suppresses hepatic lipogenesis and cholesterol synthesis while driving cholesterol efflux.\r\nMiR-206, through differentially modulating LXRa signaling in hepatocytes and macrophages, inhibits DNL, promotes cholesterol efflux, and concurrently hinders cholesterol synthesis and VLDL production. MiR-206 simulates the functions of lipid-lowering medications, statins and LXRa agonists.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSingle-cell dissection of the multicellular ecosystem and molecular features underlying microvascular invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma.\r\nThis study provides a comprehensive single-cell atlas of MVI in HCC, shedding light on the complex multicellular ecosystem and molecular features associated with MVI. These findings deepen our understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving MVI and provide valuable insights for improving clinical diagnosis and developing more effective treatment strategies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    An engineered Escherichia coli Nissle strain prevents lethal liver injury in a mouse model of tyrosinemia type 1.\r\nThis is the first report of an engineered live bacterium that can degrade tyrosine and alleviate lethal liver injury in mice with HT1. EcN-HT represents a novel engineered probiotic with the potential to treat this condition. Impact and implications Patients with hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1) is characterized by an inability to metabolize tyrosine normally and suffer from liver failure, renal dysfunction, neurological impairments, and cancer. Given the overlap and complementarity between the host and microbial metabolic pathways, the gut microbiome provides a potential chance to regulate host metabolism through degradation of tyrosine and reduction of byproducts that might be toxic. Here, we demonstrated that an engineered live bacterium, EcN-HT, could enhance tyrosine breakdown, reduce the accumulation of toxic tyrosine byproducts, and protect against lethal liver injury in Fah-knockout mice. These findings suggested that engineered live biotherapeutics that can degrade tyrosine in the gut may represent a viable and secure strategy for the prevention of lethal liver injury in HT1 as well as the mitigation of its associated pathologies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCharacteristics and outcomes of immunotherapy-related liver injury in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma versus other advanced solid tumours.\r\nDespite higher incidence and earlier onset in patients with HCC, IrLI is characterised by high rates of remission, low requirement for corticosteroid therapy and low risk of decompensation compared to other solid tumours. Hepatotoxicity leads to discontinuation in 7% of patients with HCC and does not negatively affect oncological outcomes. Impact and implications Immune-related liver injury (irLI) is common in patients with cancer receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), but whether irLI is more frequent or it is associated with a worse clinical course in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), compared to other tumours, is not known. Herein, we compared characteristics and outcomes of irLI in two prospective cohorts including patients treated with ICIs for HCC or for other oncological indications. irLI is significantly more common and it occurs earlier in patients with HCC, also after adjustment for duration of treatment exposure. However, outcomes of patients with HCC who developed irLI are not negatively affected in terms of requirement of corticosteroid therapy, hepatic decompensation, treatment discontinuation and overall survival.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nConvergent MAPK pathway alterations mediate acquired resistance to FGFR inhibitors in FGFR2 fusion-positive cholangiocarcinoma.\r\nThese findings suggest convergent genomic evolution in the MAPK pathway may be a potential mechanism of acquired resistance to FGFRi. Impact and implications We evaluated tumors and plasma from patients who previously received inhibitors of Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR), an important receptor that plays a role in cancer cell growth, especially in tumors with abnormalities in this gene such as FGFR fusions, where the FGFR gene is fused to another gene, leading to activation of cancer cell growth. We found that patients treated with FGFR inhibitors may develop mutations in other genes such as KRAS, and this can confer resistance to FGFR inhibitors. Clinical trial number NCT02052778.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSingle cell-resolved study of advanced murine MASH reveals a homeostatic pericyte signaling module.\r\nIn our current single cell-resolved study of advanced murine MASH we identified a quiescence-associated hepatic stellate cell-signaling module with potential to preserve normal sinusoid function. As expression levels of its constituents are conserved in the human liver, the signaling module may be amenable to therapeutic stimulation for restoration of sinusoid function in chronic liver disease.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Neurogastroenterol Motil\r\n    Roles of Cytokines in Pathological and Physiological Gastroesophageal Reflux Exposure.\r\n\"Microinflammation\" in physiological acid exposure groups indicate that even a mild trigger is sufficient for the initiation and progression of inflammatory activity. Additionally, the anti-inflammatory cytokines were highly increased. The results may have a potential role in the treatment of heartburn symptoms and healing of the mucosa.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the publisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Gastroenterology\r\n    Integrating Evidence to Guide Use of Biologics and Small Molecules for Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.\r\nIn this review we provide a framework for clinicians and researchers to understand key differences in sources of evidence, how different methodologies are applied to study the comparative effectiveness of advanced medical therapies in IBD, and considerations for how these sources of evidence can be used to better integrate current guideline recommendations. Over time, we anticipate this framework will allow for a transition to living guidelines and/or practice recommendations.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    Gut virome in inflammatory bowel disease and beyond.\r\nThe field of gut virome is progressively expanding, thanks to the advancements of sequencing technologies and bioinformatic pipelines.

Impact and implications In this study, we revealed a novel mechanism that the balance of Gata3 and Ramp2 in hepatocyte regulated hepatic vascular reconstitution via shifting PEDF to VEGFA during hepatectomy- or ALLPS-induced liver regeneration. We also identified serum PEDF/VEGFA index (SPVI) as a potential predictor for post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) in patients who underwent hepatectomy.

Inhibiting renal ASBT and consequently BA enrichment in TEC prevents CN and systemically decreases BA concentrations. Impact and implications Cholemic nephropathy (CN) is a severe complication of cholestasis with an unmet clinical need for therapy. We demonstrate that CN is triggered by the renal accumulation of bile acids (BA)- that are considerably increased in the systemic blood. Specifically, the proximal tubular epithelial cells (TEC) of the kidney take up BA via the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT). We developed a therapeutic compound that blocks ASBT in the kidneys, prevents BA overload in TEC, and almost completely abolished al disease hallmarks in a CN mouse model. Renal ASBT inhibition represents a potential therapeutic strategy for CN patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJAK1 promotes HDV replication and is a potential target for antiviral therapy.\r\nTaken together, we uncovered JAK1 as a key host factor for HDV replication and a potential target for new antiviral treatment. Impact and implications Chronic hepatitis D is the most aggressive form of chronic viral hepatitis with no curative treatment. New therapeutic strategies based on host targeting agents are urgently needed. Here, using loss-of-function strategies, we uncover an unexpected interaction between JAK1, a major actor of the innate antiviral response, and HDV infection. We demonstrated that JAK1 kinase activity is crucial for both the phosphorylation of the delta antigen and the replication of the virus. By demonstrating the antiviral potential of several FDA-approved JAK1 inhibitors, our results could pave the way to the development of innovative therapeutic strategies to tackle this global health threat.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the publisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Assessing risk of index serrated polyps.\r\nThe most recent US Multi Society Task Force (USMSTF) for Colorectal Cancer (CRC) post-polypectomy guidelines recommend surveillance intervals for sessile serrated lesions (SSLs) based on size, dysplasia, and number of index polyps. 1 Large (>1 cm) hyperplastic polyps (HPs), which previously had a 10 year follow-up recommendation, now have a 3-5 year interval, 2 However, most of the serrated polyp recommendations were based on low quality evidence, underscoring the need for more data.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Evolving Landscape of Colorectal Cancer Screening and Colonoscopy Practice: Insights from the Japan Polyp Study.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Toward quantification of H. pylori-associated gastric cancer risk: Further evidence supporting development of population-based strategies for H. pylori eradication.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    Getting off tract: contributions of intraorgan microbiota to cancer in extraintestinal organs.\r\nThese habitats are challenging to sample, and their low microbial biomass among large amounts of host tissue can make study challenging.

Mice with humanized livers provide a powerful preclinical model for studying the impact of the necrotic-inflammatory liver environment and neuroendocrine circadian dysfunction in hepatocarcinogenesis and anti-HCC therapy. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS-2  Human epidemiological studies have linked chronic circadian dysfunction to increased HCC risk, but direct evidence that circadian dysfunction is a human carcinogen has not been established. Here we show that circadian dysfunction induces nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-related carcinogenesis from human hepatocytes in a murine humanized liver model following the same molecular and pathologic pathways observed in human patients. The gene expression signatures of humanized HCC transcriptomes from circadian disrupted mice closely match those of human HCC with the poorest prognostic outcomes, while those from stably circadian entrained mice match those from human HCC with the best prognostic outcomes. Our studies open a new model for defining to the mechanism of NASH-related HCC and highlight the importance of circadian biology in HCC prevention and treatment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatocellular carcinoma risk in Sub-Saharan African and Afro-Surinamese individuals with chronic hepatitis B living in Europe.\r\nThis unique international multicenter cohort of SSA and AS individuals with CHB showed a 5 and 10 year cumulative HCC risk of 1% and 2.4%. The risk of HCC was negligible for individuals without advanced fibrosis at baseline, and among individuals with low baseline (m)PAGE-B scores. These findings can be used to guide HCC surveillance strategies. Impact and implications Sub-Sahara African ethnicity has been associated with a higher risk of hepatocellular carcinoma among individuals with chronic hepatitis B. In this international multicenter cohort study of sub- Saharan African and Afro-Surinamese individuals living with chronic hepatitis B in Europe, we found a 5 and 10 year cumulative incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma of 1% and 2.4%. The risk was negligible among individuals without advanced fibrosis and a low baseline (m)PAGE-B score. These findings can be used to guide HCC surveillance strategies in this population.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSIRT5 rs12216101 T>G variant is associated with liver damage and mitochondrial dysfunction in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\r\nSIRT5 rs12216101 T>G variant, heightening SIRT5 activity, is associated with liver damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress in NAFLD patients. Impact and implications In this study we discovered that the SIRT5 rs12216101 T>G variant is associated with higher disease severity in NAFLD patients. This risk variant determines SIRT5 gain-of-function, enhancing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and thus leading to oxidative stress. SIRT5 may represent a novel disease modulator in NAFLD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the publisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Editorial: Can liver fat quantification stratify cardiovascular risk in type 2 diabetes?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: HBsAg seroclearance after pegylated interferon treatment-The beginning of the end.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Noninvasive tests for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease: A refinement of the Nash-FibroTest for type 2 diabetes mellitus.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: PPIs and gastric cancer-Are we dealing with a carcinogen?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: The role of point-of-care echocardiography for assessing cirrhotic cardiomyopathy and predicting clinical outcomes in acute-on-chronic liver failure with severe sepsis.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Quantifying Endoscopic Activity in Ulcerative Colitis: Innovation, Powered by AI.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    Getting off tract: contributions of intraorgan microbiota to cancer in extraintestinal organs.\r\nThese habitats are challenging to sample, and their low microbial biomass among large amounts of host tissue can make study challenging.

This Expert Commentary incorporates important as well as recently published studies in this field, and it reflects the experiences of the authors who are experienced endoscopists with expertise in the field of artificial intelligence and colorectal polyps.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    AASLD practice guidance on risk stratification and management of portal hypertension and varices in cirrhosis.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nValidation of AGA clinical care pathway and AASLD practice guidance for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in a prospective cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes.\r\n Validation of the AGA clinical pathway in a prospectively recruited cohort with T2DM revealed a low false negative rate and avoided specialty referral in a large percentage of patients. The AASLD pathway with FIB-4 + ELF resulted in a high rate of specialty referral, which improved with utilization of higher ELF cut-points and may serve as an alternative for primary care and endocrinology clinics without access to VCTE.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    EASL-ERN position paper on liver involvement in patients with Fontan-type circulation.\r\nHowever, based on the increasing number of adult Fontan patients and recent research interest, the European Association for The Study of the Liver and the European Reference Network on Rare Liver Diseases thought a position paper timely. The aims of the current paper are: (1) to provide a clear definition and description of FALD, including clinical, analytical, radiological, haemodynamic, and histological features;  (2) to facilitate guidance for staging the liver disease;  and (3) to provide evidence- and experience-based recommendations for the management of different clinical scenarios.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeta-analysis\r\nmeta-analyses and systematic reviews\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Systematic review: Glycomics as diagnostic markers for hepatocellular carcinoma.\r\nAlterations in serum N-glycomics, characterised by increased levels of fucosylation and branching, have potential as diagnostic biomarkers for HCC. Optimisation of study design, patient selection and analysing techniques are needed before clinical implementation will be possible.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAm J Gastroenterol\r\n    Prevalence and characteristics of covert/minimal hepatic encephalopathy in patients with liver cirrhosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis.\r\n This study reports detailed data on the prevalence of C/MHE as well as clinical features associated with C/MHE, suggesting that C/MHE is one of the most common complications of liver cirrhosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Prevalence of Barrett's Esophagus and Adenocarcinoma With and Without Gastroesophageal Reflux: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.\r\n BE prevalence in those without GERD is substantial, particularly in large high-quality population-based studies.

These findings highlight the need for improved HDV screening and linkage to treatment to reduce the risk of liver-related morbidity and mortality.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Recent trends and risk factors associated with Clostridioides difficile infections in hospitalized patients with inflammatory bowel disease.\r\nRates of CDI among hospitalized patients with IBD had initially increased, but have declined since 2015. Increased comorbidity, large hospital size, public insurance, and urban teaching hospitals were associated with higher rates of CDI. CDI was associated with increased mortality in hospitalized patients with IBD. Continued vigilance, infection control, and treatment of CDI can help continue the trend of declining infection rates.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRetrospective cohort study: Effect of age as a barrier to diagnosis of eosinophilic oesophagitis.\r\nElderly patients with EoE have <50% the odds of oesophageal biopsies. There were no significant differences between elderly and non-elderly EoE patients, although endoscopic features helped discriminate the two groups. Our findings suggest that older age represents a barrier to EoE diagnosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAm J Gastroenterol\r\n    EFFECT OF GLUCAGON-LIKE PEPTIDE-1 RECEPTOR AGONISTS ON BOWEL PREPARATION FOR COLONOSCOPY.\r\n The use of GLP-1RAs was associated with a statistically significantly lower quality of bowel preparation, with additional clinical significance given a notable difference in the need for a repeat colonoscopy. It will be essential to understand the cumulative effect of medications that may delay gastric emptying on the quality of bowel preparation to better understand the appropriate measures and counseling that need to be taken before undergoing outpatient colonoscopies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease facilitates hepatitis B surface antigen seroclearance and seroconversion.\r\nIn untreated HBeAg-negative CHB patients, concurrent MASLD is associated with higher rates of HBsAg seroclearance and seroconversion. Metabolic dysfunctions have additive effects on the functional cure of CHB.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nProvince-Wide Ascertainment of Lynch Syndrome in Manitoba.\r\nA tumour screening program is more effective at detecting individuals with lower penetrant gene variants and families who do not meet traditional family history-based criteria. Cascade genetic testing is higher among clinic referrals compared to the screening program. These findings suggest a complementary role of these two ascertainment methods for Lynch syndrome.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReal World Surgical and Endoscopic Recurrence Based on Risk Profiles and Prophylaxis Utilization in Postoperative Crohn's Disease.\r\nClinical risk factors accurately illustrate patients at risk for surgical recurrence, but have limited utility in predicting endoscopic recurrence. Biologic prophylaxis may be of benefit irrespective of risk stratification and future studies should assess this.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSignificance of Crypt Atypia in Barrett's Esophagus: A Clinical, Molecular and Outcome Study.\r\nPatients with BE likely develop dysplasia via a progressive increase in the level of crypt atypia prior to the onset of dysplasia, and these changes may reflect some alteration of DNA content.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSnare tip soft coagulation vs argon plasma coagulation vs no margin treatment after large non-pedunculated colorectal polyp resection: a randomized trial.\r\nIn a randomized trial STSC and APC were each superior to no thermal margin treatment after EMR. STSC was faster to apply than APC. Because STSC also results in lower cost and plastic waste than APC (APC requires an additional device ), our study supports STSC as the preferred thermal margin treatment after colorectal EMR. (, Number NCT03654209).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndosc Int Open\r\n    Additional information obtained from mucosal biopsies is limited after pan-enteric capsule endoscopy in patients with suspected Crohn's disease.\r\nIn patients with suspected CD and an evident result of CE, the additional information obtained from biopsies is limited, and CE as a single diagnostic procedure might be feasible in selected patients. Biopsies are warranted, however, in patients with an atypical endoscopic appearance or suspected malignancy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nEUS-guided transcolonic drainage and necrosectomy in walled-off necrosis: a retrospective, single-center case series.\r\nWe included nine patients and found a technical success rate of 100%, clinical success in 89%, and one adverse event (11%). Transrectal/transcolonic endoscopic necrosectomy was needed in seven patients (78%).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nOptimal timing of simethicone administration prior to upper endoscopy: A multicenter, single-blind, randomized controlled trial.\r\nMucosal visibility can be optimized with early simethicone administration, either as a single administration or in a split-dose regimen.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nEndoscopy\r\n    Direct diverticular peroral endoscopic myotomy for the treatment of thoracic esophageal diverticula: technique and outcomes.\r\n DD-POEM was a safe technique for the management of thoracic esophageal diverticula. Owing to its simplicity and excellent performance it should be further evaluated for the treatment of this disorder.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Helicobacter pylori Treatment and Gastric Cancer Risk after Endoscopic Resection of Dysplasia: A Nationwide Cohort Study.\r\n In this nationwide cohort, H. pylori therapy after endoscopic resection of gastric dysplasia was associated with a reduced risk of gastric cancer and metachronous gastric neoplasm occurrence.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHigh soluble fiber promotes colorectal tumorigenesis through modulating gut microbiota and metabolites in mice.\r\n High-dose soluble but not insoluble fiber potentiates colorectal tumorigenesis in a dose-dependent manner by dysregulating gut microbiota and metabolites in mice.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    ARTIFICAL INTELLIGENCE-ASSISTED REAL-TIME MONITORING OF EFFECTIVE WITHDRAWAL TIME DURING COLONOSCOPY: A NOVEL QUALITY MARKER OF COLONOSCOPY.\r\nThe AI-derived EWT monitoring is a promising novel quality indicator for colonoscopy, which is more associated with ADR than SWT.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nActive Narcotic Use And Post Peroral Endoscopic Myotomy Outcomes in Esophageal Motility Disorders.\r\n Active narcotic use negatively impacts symptom improvement following POEM for treatment of esophageal motility disorders.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAnchoring fins of fully covered self-expanding metal stents affect pull-out force and stent migration.\r\nThe pull-out force as biomechanical stent property predicts the migration resistance of FCSEMS in distal biliary stenosis and may thus be used to classify stents for this application. AF-FCSEMS showed a significantly lower rate of migration and adverse events compared to FE-FCSEMS.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopic resection of giant esophageal subepithelial lesions: experience from a large tertiary center.\r\nER serves as a promising therapeutic option for esophageal g-SELs. A younger age, large tumor size, irregular shape and extraluminal growth may indicate increased ER difficulty, while a STER procedure tends to be of lower difficulty. Our nomogram model performs well to predict ER difficulty for esophageal g-SELs.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopic sleeve gastroplasty as an early tool against obesity: a multicenter international study on an overweight population.\r\n ESG is safe and effective in treating overweight patients with high BMI normalization rates. It could help halt or delay the progression to obesity.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHybrid Resection versus Conventional Resection for Laterally Spreading Lesions of the Papilla.\r\nThe novel hybrid resection technique for LSL-P management is associated with a high rate of RRA that is recalcitrant to treatment, without mitigating the risk of intraprocedural or delayed bleeding. Therefore, conventional hot-snare resection should remain the mainstay management option for treating patients with an LSL-P.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNovel powered 5.0 mm endoscopic debridement catheter for endoscopic transmural necrosectomy of pancreatic walled-off necrosis: A case series of consecutive patients from a tertiary referral center (with video).\r\n Endoscopic necrosectomy with the NecroMax 6.0 catheter was technically feasible in 96.7% with a low rate of adverse events.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPREVALENCE AND CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE MUSCLE-RETRACTING SIGN DURING ENDOSCOPIC SUBMUCOSAL DISSECTION OF LARGE MACRONODULAR COLORECTAL LESIONS (WITH VIDEO).\r\nMRS decreases oncological outcomes and increases the perforation rate. Consequently, procedures in the colon should be stopped if MRS is detected, and those in the rectum should be continued due to the morbidity of alternative therapy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatic Cyst Features Predict for Future Development of Pancreatic Cancer: Results of a Nested Case-Control Study.\r\nAge, cyst size, cyst growth rate, and high-risk or worrisome features are associated with higher risk of developing pancreatic cancer. Applying current and developing novel strategies are required to optimize early detection of pancreatic cancer after cyst diagnosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPreoperative endoscopic biliary drainage by metal versus plastic stents for resectable perihilar cholangiocarcinoma.\r\nStent failure was lower in patients with SEMS as PBD compared to plastic stents in patients with resectable pCCA. Removal during surgery was well feasible. Surgical outcomes were comparable.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nValidation and update of clinical score model to predict technical difficulty of colorectal endoscopic submucosal dissection: A multicenter prospective cohort study.\r\nThe original model achieved an acceptable level of prediction in the prospective cohort. The updated model exhibited superior performance and can be used in place of the previous version.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nWestern outcomes of circumferential endoscopic submucosal dissection for early esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.\r\nIn Western referral centers, cESD for ESCC is curative in approximately half of the lesions. It can be considered a feasible treatment in selected patients. Our results suggest the need to improve patient selection and to develop more effective therapies to prevent esophageal strictures.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    Quantification of circulating HBV RNA expressed from intrahepatic cccDNA in untreated and NUC treated patients with chronic hepatitis B.\r\n Our results support the usefulness of quantification of circulating HBV RNA expressed from cccDNA as an indicator of intrahepatic active viral reservoir in both untreated and NUC-treated CHB patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    A genetic basis of mitochondrial DNAJA3 in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-related hepatocellular carcinoma.\r\n We uncovered a genetic basis of DNAJA3 as a key player of NASH-related HCC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDevelopment of Fibro-PeN, a clinical prediction model for moderate to severe fibrosis in children with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.\r\n Existing fibrosis prediction models have limited clinical utility in children with NAFLD. Fibro-PeN offers improved performance characteristics for risk stratification by identifying moderate-to-severe fibrosis in children with NAFLD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFMO2 ameliorates nonalcoholic fatty liver disease by suppressing ER-to-Golgi transport of SREBP1.\r\n In hepatocytes, FMO2 is a novel molecule that protects against the progression of NAFL/NASH independent of enzyme activity. FMO2 impairs lipogenesis in HFD or CDAHFD-induced steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis by directly binding to SREBP1 and preventing its organelle translocation and subsequent activation. FMO2 thus is a promising molecule for targeting the activation of SREBP1 and for the treatment of NAFL/NASH.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImpact of radiological response and pattern of progression in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma treated by atezolizumab- bevacizumab.\r\nRECIST 1.1 and mRECIST criteria predict OS with more responders identified by mRECIST and appearance of new extrahepatic lesion or vascular invasion was associated with a poor prognosis. A noticeable discrepancy was observed between patients classified as progressor at reviewing and the decision reached during MTB.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMacrophage STING-YAP axis controls hepatic steatosis by promoting autophagic degradation of lipid droplets.\r\n Macrophage STING-YAP axis controls hepatic steatosis by reprogramming lipid metabolism in a TMEM205/MFN2/PDI-dependent pathway. These findings highlight the regulatory mechanism of macrophage STING-driven YAP activity on lipid control.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMendelian randomization in hepatology: A review of principles, opportunities, and challenges.\r\nIn this concise review, we describe the concepts, assumptions, and interpretation of Mendelian Randomization as related to studies in hepatology. We focus on the strengths and weaknesses of the approach for a non-statistical audience, using an illustrative example to assess the causal relationship between body mass index and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNew insights into the molecular basis of alcohol abstinence and relapse in alcohol-associated liver disease.\r\nIn addition, support with psychological and behavioral treatments is essential to address the multiple dimensions of AUD. In the future, a personalized approach considering these novel targets can contribute to significantly decreasing the alcohol-related burden of disease.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nWnt/ß-catenin and NFB signaling synergize to trigger growth-factor-free regeneration of adult primary human hepatocytes.\r\nThis study revealed a network of NFB, TGFß, and Wnt/ß-catenin that controls human hepatocyte regeneration in the absence of exogenous growth factors, identified novel regulators of hepatocyte proliferation, and highlighted the potential of organotypic culture systems for chemogenomic interrogation of complex physiological processes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    A prospective, multicenter, three-cohort study evaluating contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) in patients with cirrhosis.\r\nAKI risk after CECT in cirrhosis is low, not significantly different from that of the general population and of the cirrhotic population unexposed to ICM. It mostly consists in mild and rapidly resolving episodes of renal dysfunction and it is not associated with tubular kidney injury. Patients with ongoing infections appear to be the only ones at higher risk of AKI. Impact and implications Nephrotoxicity due to intravenous iodinated contrast media (ICM) in patients with cirrhosis is still a debated issue, as the available evidence is limited and based on very heterogeneous studies, often conducted on small and retrospective cohorts. In this prospective three-cohort study we found that intravenous administration of ICM was associated with a low risk of AKI, similar to that of the general population and to that of patients with cirrhosis unexposed to ICM. Patients with ongoing infections were the only to have a significantly increased risk of CI-AKI. Therefore, the actual recommendations of performing contrast imaging studies cautiously in cirrhosis do not seem to be reasonable anymore, with the exception of infected patients, which have a significantly higher risk of CI-AKI.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHigher TP53BP2 expression is associated with HBsAg loss in peginterferon-alpha-treated patients with chronic hepatitis B.\r\n Rs7519753 C allele is associated with an increased probability of serum HBsAg loss in patients with CHB post-Peg-IFNa treatment and elevated hepatic TP53BP2 expression. TP53BP2 enhances the response of the hepatocyte to IFN-a by suppressing SOCS2 expression. Impact and implications Chronic Hepatitis B (CHB) remains a global public health issue. Although current antiviral therapies are more effective in halting disease progression, only a few patients achieve functional cure for hepatitis B with HBsAg loss, highlighting the urgent need for a cure for CHB. This study revealed that the SNP rs7519753 C allele, which is associated with high expression of hepatic TP53BP2, significantly increases the likelihood of serum HBsAg loss in CHB patients undergoing Peg-IFNa therapy. This finding not only provides an exciting predictor for HBsAg loss but identifies a potential therapeutic target for Peg-IFNa treatment. We believe our results are of great interest to a wide range of stakeholders, including patients and patient organizations, the medical community, academia, the life science industry, and the general public.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImmune responses and clinical outcomes after COVID-19 vaccination in patients with liver disease and in liver transplant recipients.\r\n After three COVID-19 vaccines, patients with liver disease generally develop robust antibody and T cell responses to vaccination and have mild COVID-19. However, LTR have sustained no/low antibody titres and appear most vulnerable to severe disease. Impact and implications Standardised assessments of the immune response to different COVID-19 vaccines in patients liver disease are lacking. We performed antibody and T cell assays at multiple timepoints following up to three vaccine doses in a large cohort of patients with a range of liver conditions. Overall, the three most widely available vaccine platforms were immunogenic and appeared to protect against severe breakthrough COVID-19. This will provide reassurance to patients with chronic liver disease who were deemed at high risk of severe COVID-19 during the pre-vaccination era, however, liver transplant recipients had the lowest antibody titres and remained vulnerable to severe breakthrough infection. We also characterise the immune response to multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants and describe the interaction between disease type, severity, and vaccine platform. These insights may prove useful in the event of future viral infections which also require rapid vaccine development and delivery to liver patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPredicting survival in patients with 'non-high-risk' acute variceal bleeding receiving ß-blockers+ligation to prevent re-bleeding.\r\n The majority of 'non-high-risk' patients with AVB have an excellent outcome, if treated according to current recommendations. However, about one fifth of patients, i.e., those with CTP =8 and/or high creatinine levels or hyponatremia, have a considerable risk of death within 1 year of the index bleed. Future clinical trials should investigate whether elective TIPS placement reduces mortality in these patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the publisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Blue Notes.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCommon Instances of Low-value Care in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.\r\nThis review is meant to bring attention to value-based care in IBD and provide guidance to treating practitioners.
