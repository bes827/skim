This expert commentary incorporates important as well as recently published studies in this field, and it reflects the experiences of the authors who are experts in treating patients with cyclic vomiting syndrome.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeta-analysis\r\nmeta-analyses and systematic reviews\r\n\r\n\r\n    Gut\r\n    Prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia after acute gastroenteritis: systematic review and meta-analysis.\r\n In a large systematic review and meta-analysis, 14.5% of individuals experiencing acute gastroenteritis developed PI-IBS and 12.7% PI-FD, with greater than fourfold increased odds for IBS and threefold for FD. Proinflammatory microbes, including Proteobacteria and subcategories, and SARS-CoV-2, may be associated with the development of PI-IBS and PI-FD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Impact of pre-transplant immune checkpoint inhibitor use on post-transplant outcomes in HCC: A systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis.\r\nAdditionally, a higher number of immune checkpoint inhibitor cycles and tumor burden within Milan criteria at the completion of immunotherapy may predict a decreased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence, but this observation requires further validation in larger prospective studies. CODE FOR INTERNATIONAL PROSPECTIVE REGISTER OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS (PROSPERO): CRD42023494951.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Clinical trial: The effectiveness of long-acting somatostatin analogue for output reduction of high-output intestinal fistula or small bowel enterostomy. A randomised controlled trial.\r\nIn patients with a high-output fistula or small bowel enterostomy, addition of lanreotide to current standard treatment can provide a clinically relevant output reduction.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFaecal biomarkers for diagnosis and prediction of disease course in treatment-naïve patients with IBD.\r\nThis study provides new insight into the diagnostic and prognostic capability of neutrophil and eosinophil biomarkers in IBD and suggests that MPO, alone or in combination with FC, may add to the diagnostic power of faecal biomarkers.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOutcomes of patients with alcohol-associated hepatitis and acute kidney injury - Results from the HRS Harmony Consortium.\r\nHospitalised patients with cirrhosis and AKI presenting with AH had higher 90-day mortality than those without AH, but this may have been driven by higher MELD-Na rather than AH itself. However, in patients with hepatorenal syndrome, AH was an independent predictor of mortality.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe effect of vitamin E and docosahexaenoic acid ethyl ester on Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD)-A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial (PUVENAFLD).\r\nThe combination of DHA + vitamin E or either agent alone did not demonstrate efficacy on reducing liver fat or aminotransferases in the studied population.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAm J Gastroenterol\r\n    Association of Acetaminophen (Paracetamol) Use with Severity and Outcomes in Patients with Viral Hepatitis-Associated Acute Liver Failure.\r\nAPAP use in AVH-ALF is common and may negatively impact outcomes compared to little or no APAP exposure. Prospective studies of the most safe and effective dose of APAP to use in patients with AVH are needed.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nComparative risk of serious infection with vedolizumab vs anti-TNF in inflammatory bowel disease: results from nationwide Swedish registers.\r\nVedolizumab was associated with increased risks of serious infections compared to anti-TNF in Crohn's disease, but not in ulcerative colitis. Nonetheless, the panorama of serious infections seemed to differ between the drugs. Our findings underscore the importance of clinical awareness of infections and the safety profile of the two therapies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGLP1-RA use prior to endoscopy is associated with low retained gastric contents: a multicenter cross-sectional analysis.\r\n In this multicenter study, very low rates of retained gastric contents were seen during endoscopy in patients on GLP1-RAs and most were in patients with T2DM. Our findings suggest an individualized approach rather than universal pre-operative holding of medications prior to endoscopy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHIV infection is associated with a less aggressive phenotype of inflammatory bowel disease. A multicenter study of the ENEIDA registry.\r\nHIV infection appears to be associated with a less aggressive phenotype of IBD and a lesser use of non-biological therapies and biologicals but entails a greater risk of developing OI.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHealthcare Resource Utilization and Costs Associated With Eosinophilic Esophagitis Among Commercially Insured Patients in the United States.\r\n EoE imposes substantial economic burden. More effective and targeted treatments that improve outcomes for patients are needed.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHistologic Activity from Neoterminal Ileal Biopsies in Patients with Crohn's Disease in Endoscopic Remission is Associated with Postoperative Recurrence.\r\nIn patients with postoperative CD, histologic activity despite complete endoscopic remission is associated with composite, endoscopic and radiographic, recurrence. Further understanding of the role of histologic activity in patients with Rutgeerts' i0 disease may provide a novel target to reduce disease recurrence in this population.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImpact of Bowel Preparation Quality on Colonoscopy Findings and Colorectal Cancer Deaths in a Nation-Wide Colorectal Cancer Screening Program.\r\n Fair bowel preparation on the Aronchick Scale was not only associated with a lower adenoma detection probability but also with increased risk of PCCRC death. Efforts should be made to increase bowel cleansing above fair scores.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImpact of Diabetes, Drug-Induced Liver Injury, and Sepsis on Outcomes in MAFLD-Related Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure.\r\n Almost half of MAFLD-ACLF patients die within 90 days. Diabetes and non-viral precipitants such as DILI and sepsis lead to adverse outcomes. The new MAFLD-MELD-Na and MAFLD-AARC scores provide reliable 90-day mortality predictions for MAFLD-ACLF patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOlder Age as a Worrisome Feature in Patients With Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms: a Long-Term Surveillance Study.\r\n Older patients with IPMNs were at a higher risk of developing pancreatic carcinoma during surveillance. Surgically fit elderly patients may be good candidates for periodic surveillance aimed at a reduction of pancreatic cancer-related deaths.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPsychiatric disorders among 5800 patients with microscopic colitis: A nationwide population-based matched cohort study.\r\n Patients with MC are at increased risk of incident psychiatric disorders compared to the general population.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Liver Cirrhosis Network Cohort Study: Cirrhosis Definition, Study Population, and Endpoints.\r\n The LCN Cohort Study design will inform the natural history of cirrhosis in contemporary patients with compensated cirrhosis. The LCN Definitions and Measures Committee developed criteria for the definition of cirrhosis to standardize entry into this multi-center cohort study and standardized criteria for liver-related outcome measures. This effort has produced definitions intended to be both sensitive and specific as well as easily operationalized by study staff such that outcomes critical to the LCN cohort are identified and reported in an accurate and generalizable fashion.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Survival Benefit of Re-abstinence After Harmful Alcohol Use Following Early Liver Transplant for Severe Alcohol-Associated Hepatitis: A Multi-Center ACCELERATE Study.\r\nAchieving re-abstinence after post-LT harmful alcohol use is associated with similar five-year post-LT survival compared to those without evidence of post-LT harmful alcohol use. Our findings highlight the importance of early detection and treatment of post-LT alcohol use.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nWhen Perfect Is the Enemy of Good: Results of a RAND Appropriateness Panel on Treat to Target in Asymptomatic IBD.\r\n Appropriateness ratings can help guide clinical decision-making about changing therapy to achieve endoscopic remission in asymptomatic patients with IBD until data from ongoing randomized studies are available.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Drug-Induced Liver Injury in Latin America: 10-year experience of the Latin American DILI (LATINDILI) Network Drug-induced liver injury in Latin America.\r\n Features of DILI in Latin America are comparable to other prospective registries. However, the pattern of drugs responsible for DILI differs. An increasing incidence of HDS, with high mortality rate, and likewise nimesulide and nitrofurantoin was noted. Thus, public health policies should raise awareness of the potential adverse effects of these compounds.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDynamics of liver stiffness measurement and clinical course of primary biliary cholangitis.\r\nTracking longitudinal changes in LSM using VCTE provides valuable insights into PBC prognosis, offering a robust predictive measure for the risk of SCE. LSM could be used as a clinically relevant surrogate endpoint in PBC clinical trials.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopy\r\n    Prospective feasibility study of a novel rigidizing stabilizing overtube in the resection of complex gastrointestinal polyps.\r\n The novel ROT was safe, with high technical and clinical success during resection of complex colon polyps. Future studies will determine timing of implementation during routine endoscopic resection.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Gut Pathobiont-Derived Outer Membrane Vesicles Drive Liver Inflammation and Fibrosis in PSC-IBD.\r\n This study demonstrates the contribution of gut pathobionts in releasing OMVs that traverse the mucosal barrier, and thus, promote liver inflammation and fibrosis in PSC-IBD. OMVs might represent a critical new environmental factor that interacts with other disease factors to cause inflammation and thus define potential new targets for fibrosis therapy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMolecular Mechanisms Underlying Loss of Vascular and Epithelial Integrity in Irritable Bowel Syndrome.\r\n Epithelial and vascular barriers are compromised in IBS patients and contribute to clinical manifestations.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe global incident gastrointestinal cancers attributable to suboptimal diets from 1990 to 2018.\r\nAlthough the proportional attributable GI incidence remains relatively stable, the doubling of absolute cases from 1990 to 2018, along with the discrepancies among urbanicity and countries/regions, informs dietary priorities and more targeted preventive measures.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    An integrated analysis of bile acid metabolism in humans with severe obesity.\r\nCharacterization of the portal BA composition in relation to peripheral and fecal BA increased insight into the dynamics of BA metabolism in individuals with obesity. Peripheral BA composition was much more diverse due to microbial metabolism. About 24% of the portal samples was surprisingly low in total BA;  the underlying mechanism requires further exploration.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Effect of pemvidutide, a GLP-1/glucagon dual receptor agonist, on MASLD: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.\r\nIn subjects with MASLD, weekly pemvidutide treatment yielded significant reductions in LFC, markers of hepatic inflammation, and body weight compared to placebo. Impact and implications MASLD, and MASH, are strongly associated with overweight and obesity and it is believed that the excess liver fat associated with obesity is an important driver of these diseases. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists elicit weight loss through centrally and peripherally mediated effects on appetite. Unlike GLP-1R agonists, glucagon receptor (GCGR) agonists act directly on the liver to stimulate fatty acid oxidation and inhibit lipogenesis, potentially providing a more potent mechanism for liver fat content (LFC) reduction than weight loss alone. This study demonstrated the ability of once-weekly treatment with pemvidutide, a dual GLP-1R/GCGR agonist, to significantly reduce LFC, hepatic inflammatory activity, and body weight, suggesting that pemvidutide may be an effective treatment for both MASH and obesity. Clinical trial number NCT05006885.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInfection history imprints prolonged changes to the epigenome, transcriptome and function of Kupffer cells.\r\n Our study demonstrates that a prior exposure to a parasitic infection induces trained immunity in KCs, reshaping their identity and function in the long-term. Impact and implications Although the liver is frequently affected during infections, and despite housing a major population of resident macrophages known as Kupffer cells (KCs), it is currently unclear whether infections can durably alter KCs and their niche cells. Our study provides a comprehensive investigation into the long-term impact of a prior, cured parasitic infection, unveiling long-lasting ontogenic, epigenetic, transcriptomic and functional changes to KCs as well as KC niche cells, which may contribute to KC remodeling. Our data suggest that infection history may continuously reprogram KCs throughout life with potential implications for subsequent disease susceptibility in the liver, influencing preventive and therapeutic approaches.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPatient-reported outcomes in chronic hepatitis delta: An exploratory analysis of the Phase III MYR301 trial of bulevirtide.\r\n PROs indicate that 48-week treatment with bulevirtide monotherapy may improve aspects of HRQoL in patients with CHD. Impact and implications Bulevirtide 2 mg is the only approved treatment for patients with chronic hepatitis delta (CHD) in the EU. Patients with CHD have worse quality of life scores than those with chronic hepatitis B. Bulevirtide treatment for 48 weeks reduced HDV RNA and alanine aminotransferase levels and was well tolerated among patients with CHD. For the first time, this study shows that patients who received bulevirtide therapy for 48 weeks reported improvements in physical and hepatitis-related quality of life domains compared to those who did not receive therapy (control group). Clinical trial registration\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nVaried immune responses of HBV-specific B cells in patients undergoing pegylated interferon-alpha treatment for chronic hepatitis B.\r\nAfter PEG-IFNα treatment, HBsAg- and HBcAg-specific B-cells exhibit various changes in antibody secretion. Their functional differences are reflected in the alterations in phenotypes and subtypes. The presence of CD40L + Tfh-cells is associated with the active recovery of HBsAg-specific B-cells. Impact and implications HBV-related complications and hepatocellular carcinoma remain the leading causes of mortality from chronic liver disease worldwide, and a cure is rarely achieved with antiviral therapies. Elucidating the immunological mechanisms underlying the functional cure of CHB patients offers a promising therapeutic strategy for viral clearance, such as therapeutic vaccine. We analyzed the alterations in HBV-specific B-cells in patients treated with PEG-IFNα and identified novel pathways for immunotherapeutic boosting of B cell immunity.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Editorial: Trajectory of soluble programmed cell death protein-1 and ligand-1 in HBV-infected individuals treated with pegylated interferon-implications for stopping rules and the HBV cure programme.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Diet and Microbiome-directed therapy 2.0 for IBD.\r\nWe also review the use of diet as a therapeutic tool in IBD, including the effects in induction and maintenance, special diets, and exclusive enteral nutrition. Finally, we highlight the challenges and opportunities for the translation of diet and microbiome interventions into clinical practice, such as the need for personalization, manufacturing and regulatory hurdles, and the specificity to take into account for clinical trial design.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHow Artificial Intelligence Will Transform Clinical Care, Research, and Trials for Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\nAs a complex disease with entangled relationships between genomics, metabolomics, microbiome, and the environment, IBD stands to benefit greatly from methodologies that can handle this complexity.

Children conceived by mothers treated for IBD with allopurinol/thiopurine co-therapy do not seem to have an increased risk of congenital anomalies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAm J Gastroenterol\r\n    Risk of Pancreatitis After Endoscopic Ultrasound-Guided Fine Needle Aspiration of Pancreatic Cystic Lesions: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.\r\nWe note with high certainty that pancreatitis following EUS-FNA of PCLs is infrequent and mild in severity with no mortality in the included cohort. EUS-TTNB may serve as a significant risk factor for EUS-FNA-related pancreatitis risk;  however, further studies are needed to delineate other predisposing characteristics.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Additional yield of random biopsy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.\r\nThe additional yields of RB were 10.34% and 16.20% for per-patient and per-lesion analyses, respectively.

Efforts should focus on candidates' selection based on comorbidities as well as the prevention of infection and cardiovascular events standing as the main cause of death. Impact and implications While short-term outcomes following liver transplantation in the most severely ill cirrhotic patients (ACLF-3) are known, long-term data are limited, raising questions about the utility of graft allocation in the context of scarce medical resources. This study provides a favorable long-term update, confirming no differences in 5- and 10-year patient and graft survival following liver transplantation in ACLF-3 patients compared to matched ACLF-2, ACLF-1, and no-ACLF patients. The study highlights the risk of dying from infection and cardiovascular causes in the long-term and identifies scores including comorbidities evaluation, such as the age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index, as independently associated with long-term survival. Therefore, physicians should consider the cumulative burden of comorbidities when deciding to transplant these patients. Additionally, after transplantation, the study encourages mitigating infectious risk with tailored immunosuppressive regimens and managing tightly cardiovascular risk over time.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLong-term outcomes after hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion and transplantation of 1,202 donor livers in a real-world setting (HOPE-REAL study).\r\nThis study shows excellent 5-year survival after transplantation of HOPE-treated DBD and DCD livers with low rates of graft loss due to PNF or IC, irrespective of their individual risk profile.

Impact and implications Metabolic risk factors such as overweight, diabetes or dyslipidemia, and alcohol consumption can cause liver disease. These factors frequently co-exist, but their joint effects on liver fibrosis remain uncertain. This study analyzes subjects form the general population with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) enrolled in Spain and U.S. We show that moderate alcohol consumption has a supra-additive effect with metabolic risk factors, exponentially increasing the risk of liver fibrosis. These results suggest that patients with unhealthy metabolic status and MASLD have no safe limits of daily alcohol intake.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPhase 1b/2a randomized study of heterologous ChAdOx1-HBV/MVA-HBV therapeutic vaccination (VTP-300) as monotherapy and combined with low-dose nivolumab in virally-suppressed patients with chronic hepatitis B.\r\nVTP-300 induced CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and lowered HBsAg in a subset of patients with baseline values below 100 IU/ml.

Our data also offers future directions in formulating a cocktail of gpE1/gpE2 antigens from a small selection of HCV genotypes to further enhance cross-neutralisation of global HCV strains and hopefully, achieving global protection. Impact and implications An HCV vaccine is urgently required to prevent the high global incidence of HCV infection and disease. Since HCV is a highly heterogeneous virus, it is desirable for a vaccine to elicit antibodies that neutralise the infectivity of most global strains. To this end, we have compared the immunoreactivity and antigenicity of recombinant H77C E1E2 heterodimer with that of H77C E2 alone and show that the former exhibits more cross-neutralising epitopes and demonstrates a broader cross-neutralisation profile in vitro. In addition, our data suggests a way to further broaden cross-neutralisation using a combination of E1E2 antigens derived from a few different HCV clades.

Our results support the observations that gut dysbiosis is associated with long-term survival. Since our data do not allow us to infer causality, more preclinical research is needed to understand mechanisms before we can determine whether gut microbiome-directed therapies may be designed to improve long-term outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatic STAT5 activation promotes KrasG12D-induced and inflammation-induced acinar-to-ductal metaplasia and pancreatic cancer.\r\n Collectively, our findings identified pancreatic STAT5 activation as a key downstream effector of oncogenic KRAS signalling that is critical for ADM initiation and PDAC progression, highlighting its potential therapeutic vulnerability.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    A novel phosphodiesterase inhibitor for the treatment of chronic liver injury and metabolic diseases.\r\nIn conclusion, we synthesized and demonstrated that MDL3, a novel PDE4B and PDE5A inhibitor, presents a promising avenue of exploration for treating CLD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAlcohol-associated liver disease and public health policies.\r\nIn this narrative review, we will review major US national as well as worldwide alcohol related public health policies with a particular focus on describing how such policies have influenced rates of ALD and its complications and outcomes. We will describe global alcohol public health policy frameworks, review key alcohol policy models, describe existing notable policies and their impacts, and highlight gaps in ALD policy literature where further research and policy interventions could reduce rates mortality from ALD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIntegrated and collaborative care across the spectrum of alcohol-associated liver disease and alcohol use disorder.\r\nHere, we review the role of AUD care in ALD treatment, the effects of AUD treatment on liver-related outcomes, the impact of comorbid conditions such as other substance use disorders, obesity, and metabolic syndrome, the current landscape of integrated and collaborative care for ALD and AUD in various treatment settings. We further review knowledge gaps and unmet needs that remain, including the role of precision medicine, the application of harm reduction approaches, the impact of health disparities, the need for additional AUD treatment options as well as further efforts to support implementation and dissemination.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPerformance of spleen stiffness measurement to rule out high-risk varices in patients with porto-sinusoidal vascular disorder.\r\n This study gathering a total of 309 PSVD patients showed that SSM-VCTE ≤40 kPa combined with bilirubin <1 mg/dL identifies patients with PSVD and portal hypertension with a probability of HRV <5%, in whom screening endoscopy can be spared.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReduction of Z alpha-1 antitrypsin polymers in human iPSC-hepatocytes and mice by LRRK2 inhibitors.\r\nMechanistically, this effect was achieved through induction of autophagy. Our findings support the use of CZC-25146 and LRRK2 inhibitors in hepatic proteinopathy research and their further investigation as novel therapeutic candidates for A1ATD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRole of Point-of-Care ultrasound (POCUS) in clinical hepatology.\r\nRenal ultrasound can identify renal and post-renal causes of AKI and aid in diagnosis of pre-renal AKI through volume assessment. In this review, we address the principles and methods of POCUS in hospitalized patients and in outpatients with cirrhosis and discuss the application of this diverse modality in clinical hepatology.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Differing genetic variants associated with liver fat and their contrasting relationships with cardiovascular diseases and cancer.\r\n This study provides fresh insight into the heterogeneous effect of liver fat on health outcomes. It challenges the notion that liver fat per se is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, underscoring the dependency of this association on the specific mechanisms that drive fat accumulation in the liver. However, excess liver fat, regardless of how achieved, appears to be causally linked to liver cirrhosis and cancers in a dose dependent manner. Impact and implication This research advances our understanding of the heterogeneity in mechanisms influencing liver fat accumulation, providing new insights into how liver fat accumulation may impact various health outcomes. The findings challenge the notion that liver fat is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and highlight the mechanistic effect of some genetic variants on fat accumulation and the development of cardiovascular diseases. This study is of particular importance for healthcare professionals including physicians and researchers as well as patients as it allows for more targeted and personalised treatment by understanding the relationship between liver fat and various health outcomes. The findings emphasise the need for a personalised management approach and a reshaping of risk assessment criteria. It also provides room for prioritising a clinical intervention aimed at reducing liver fat content (likely by intentional weight loss, however, achieved) that could help protect against liver related fibrosis and cancer.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHistological predictors of aggressive recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma after liver resection.\r\n The presence of mVI/S was the only independent risk factor for aggressive recurrence and mortality. This has important implications for early-stage patient management, especially in the setting of adjuvant immunotherapy or ab initio LT.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMetabolic phenotyping of patients with Advanced Chronic Liver Disease for better characterization of Cirrhosis Regression.\r\nWe identified and validated a group of lipid biomarkers associated with regression of fibrosis that could be used as non-invasive biomarker for detecting regression of fibrosis in cACLD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNeuropilin-1 is a novel host factor modulating the entry of hepatitis B virus.\r\nOur findings indicate that NRP1 is a novel host factor for HBV infection, which interacts with preS1 and NTCP to modulate HBV entry into hepatocytes. Impact and implications HBV infection is a global public health problem, but the understanding of the early infection process of HBV remains limited. Through single-cell sequencing, we identified a novel host factor, NRP1, which modulates HBV entry by interacting with HBV preS1 and NTCP. Moreover, antagonists targeting NRP1 can inhibit HBV infection both in vitro and in vivo. This study could further advance our comprehension of the early infection process of HBV.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nType-I interferon shapes peritoneal immunity in cirrhosis and drives caspase-5-mediated progranulin release upon infection.\r\nType-I IFN shapes peritoneal immune responses and regulates caspase-5-mediated progranulin release during SBP. Impact and implications Patients with cirrhosis exhibit impaired immune responses and increased susceptibility to bacterial infections. This study reveals that type-I interferon responses, triggered by pathogen-associated molecular patterns, are crucial in regulating macrophage activation and priming them for inflammatory responses. Additionally, we elucidate the mechanisms by which type-I interferons promote the release of progranulin from macrophages during spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Our findings enhance understanding of how bacterial translocation affects immune responses, identify novel biomarkers for inflammasome activation during infections, and point to potential therapeutic targets.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Editorial: Disorders of gut-brain interaction-Don't forget the older person.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Editorial on FODMAPs in IBS: Revisiting Restriction.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopy\r\n    ESGE and Social Media in the 21st Century.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nVisualized biliary cannulation during ERCP: do we really need it?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Deconstructing the \"pain\" points when considering the impact of Brain Gut Behavior Therapies on IBS.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTargeting the IL-23 Pathway in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\nFurthermore, we address available data on the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of IL-23-specific p19-inhibitors in the treatment of IBD and discuss important studies performed in other immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.

Clinical guidelines should emphasize the addition of aerobic exercise in lifestyle treatments for the greatest histologic benefit in individuals with advanced MASH. Clinical trial number NCT03151798.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHistological predictors of aggressive recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma after liver resection.\r\n The presence of mVI/S was the only independent risk factor for aggressive recurrence and mortality. This has important implications for early-stage patient management, especially in the setting of adjuvant immunotherapy or ab initio LT.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nProcoagulant phenotype of virus-infected pericytes is associated with portal thrombosis and intrapulmonary vascular dilations in fatal COVID-19.\r\nSARS-CoV-2 infection of liver pericytes elicits a local procoagulant response associated with extensive portal microthrombosis, IPVD and worsening respiratory failure in fatal COVID-19. Impact and implications Vascular involvement of the liver represents a serious complication of COVID-19 infection that must be considered in the work-up of patients with long-lasting and progressively worsening respiratory failure, as it may associate with the development of intrapulmonary vascular dilations. This clinical picture is associated with a pro-coagulant phenotype of portal venule pericytes, which is induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection of pericytes. Both observations provide a model that may apply, at least in part, to other vascular disorders of the liver, featuring obliterative portal venopathy, similarly characterized at the clinical level by development of hypoxemia and at the histological level, by phlebosclerosis and reduced caliber of the portal vein branches in the absence of cirrhosis. Moreover, our findings bring light to an as yet overlooked player of thrombosis pathophysiology, i.e. pericytes, which may provide novel therapeutic tools to halt prothrombotic mechanisms.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSex and ethnic disparities in hepatitis B evaluation and treatment across the world.\r\nEvaluation and treatment rates were suboptimal for patients with CHB in both the East and West, with significant sex and ethnic disparities. Improved linkage to care with linguistically competent and culturally sensitive approaches is needed. Impact and implications Significant sex and ethnic disparities exist in hepatitis B evaluation and treatment, with female treatment-eligible patients about 50% less likely to receive antiviral treatment and Asian patients from Western regions also about 50% less likely to receive adequate evaluation or treatment compared to Asians from the East (there was no significant difference between Asian patients from the East and non-Asian patients). Improved linkage to care with linguistically competent and culturally sensitive approaches is needed.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) polymorphisms may influence HDV RNA load and early response to bulevirtide.\r\nNTCP genetic polymorphisms were identified by Sanger sequencing. Results Of the 6 NTCP polymorphisms studied in 209 CHD untreated patients, carriers of rs17556915 TT/CC (N=142) compared to CT (N=67) genotype presented higher median HDV RNA levels (5.39 vs 4.75 log T genetic polymorphisms may influence baseline HDV RNA load both in untreated and BLV treated patients with CHD and may contribute to identify patients with different early virological responses to BLV.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nType-I interferon shapes peritoneal immunity in cirrhosis and drives caspase-5-mediated progranulin release upon infection.\r\nType-I IFN shapes peritoneal immune responses and regulates caspase-5-mediated progranulin release during SBP. Impact and implications Patients with cirrhosis exhibit impaired immune responses and increased susceptibility to bacterial infections. This study reveals that type-I interferon responses, triggered by pathogen-associated molecular patterns, are crucial in regulating macrophage activation and priming them for inflammatory responses. Additionally, we elucidate the mechanisms by which type-I interferons promote the release of progranulin from macrophages during spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Our findings enhance understanding of how bacterial translocation affects immune responses, identify novel biomarkers for inflammasome activation during infections, and point to potential therapeutic targets.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Editorial: Genetics for non-invasive risk stratification-Finding the needle in the haystack?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Reading the cholate: A new gateway to portal hypertension and oesophageal varices.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndosc Int Open\r\n    Retention of endoscopic capsules in diverticula: Literature review of a capsule endoscopy rarity.\r\nThe most common type is Meckel's diverticulum, and endoscopy is the primary management.
