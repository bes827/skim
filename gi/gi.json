Standardized reporting could enhance the quality of UGI endoscopy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTraining esophagogastroduodenoscopy skills: a randomized multicenter trial comparing simulation-based training versus clinical training.\r\nSBT prior to CBT reduces the number of supervised procedures required to achieve independent procedural completion without negatively affecting patient satisfaction or increasing training costs. These findings support the routine implementation of SBT when learning EGD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nWater consumption before-and-after simple intervention using infographic poster during bowel preparation for colonoscopy: A prospective observational study. \r\nNo significant differences were observed in fluid intake or bowel cleansing quality. The educational poster intervention promoting appropriate flush selection during bowel preparation may be a simple option for reducing water consumption, leading to green endoscopy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Implications of shame for patient reported outcomes in Bowel Disorders of Gut-Brain Interaction. \r\nShame appears to be a particularly important emotion deriving from the experience of GI symptoms in Bowel DGBI, influencing the associations between these symptoms and important patient reported outcomes. An empathetic doctor-patient relationship and psychological therapies may be helpful for individuals with Bowel DGBI experiencing high levels of shame.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    Clinical utility of suprapapillary plastic stents for lifelong biliary drainage in unresectable malignant hilar biliary obstruction. \r\nSPPS, as the first stent for unresectable MHBO, was considered superior to SEMS for the intermittent maintenance of LBD. Achieving LBD success or extending TLBDF may help preserve therapeutic options.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nComparison of endoscopic band ligation versus over-the-scope clip for colonic diverticular bleeding: A propensity score-matched cohort analysis. \r\nNo significant differences in initial hemostasis, requirements for IVR or surgery, requirements of red blood cell transfusion, and adverse events were observed between the two groups. OTSC was more effective than EBL for reducing early recurrent bleeding rate in endoscopic hemostasis for CDB.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFocused communication Three-dimensional volume estimates of pancreatic fluid collections in relation to clinical outcomes of endoscopic ultrasound-guided treatment. \r\nThe maximum diameter represented a comparable model goodness-of-fit. PFC volume was associated with the outcomes of EUS-guided interventions, and the maximum diameter may be a reasonable surrogate.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOptimal Interval of Screening Endoscopy for Reducing Gastric Cancer Mortality: A Nationwide Cohort Study. \r\nPatients who underwent screening at intervals ≤3 years had a significantly reduced risk of GC-specific mortality compared to those screened at intervals >3 years. A 3-year screening interval may be an effective strategy for high-risk regions.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPerformance comparison of quantitative and qualitative fecal immunochemical tests in community-based colorectal cancer screening. \r\nQnFIT exhibited lower positivity, higher DR at colonoscopy and PPV for CRC over qlFIT. Almost half of colonoscopy resources were saved by qnFIT, although adenoma and polyp were missed in population screening.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    Comparative risk of high-risk neoplasia after polypectomy among individuals aged below 50 years versus 50 years and older. \r\nAmong screened individuals, in both age groups, the association was particularly strong for individuals with index high-risk lesions and peaked at 3 years after polypectomy, with HRs (95% CI) of 4.60 (3.63 to 5.84) and 5.59 (3.89 to 8.03) for young adults with index high-risk adenoma and high-risk SPs, respectively. Patients undergoing polypectomy at a screening colonoscopy below age 50 years exhibited a similarly increased risk of metachronous neoplasia as those aged ≥50 years, suggesting that current surveillance guidelines developed in old adults may apply to young adults.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSingle-cell multimodal analysis reveals the dynamic immunopathogenesis of HBV-ACLF progression. \r\nSix immune cellular modules (CMs) were identified for patient stratification, with CM2 and CM6 showing strong predictive value for disease outcomes, and CM3 indicating a potential early therapeutic window. Our longitudinal multiomics study revealed the dynamic evolution of the immune response in HBV-ACLF and characterised diverse immune patterns for the future precise management and therapeutic intervention.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSmoking affects gut immune system of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases by modulating metabolomic profiles and mucosal microbiota. \r\nWe demonstrated that smoking affects the gut immune system by modulating mucosal microbiota. Our findings provide insights into how smoking can have beneficial or detrimental effects on UC or CD, respectively, and may shed light on the reasons why individuals with UC who quit smoking experience disease exacerbation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    A novel mechanism involving USP53-regulated BSEP trafficking underlies low-GGT intrahepatic cholestasis.\r\nLoss of USP53 interaction with MYO5B and its p.(Arg824Cys) variant impaired BSEP trafficking in USP53- and MYO5B-asociated low-GGT intrahepatic cholestasis. These results provide a novel mechanism that underlies USP53-PFIC and implicates USP53 in the pathogenesis of MYO5B-PFIC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCX3CR1+ macrophages interact with HSCs to promote HCC through CD8+ T-cell suppression. \r\nMoreover, genetic deficiency of CX3CR1 in myeloid cells or pharmacological inhibition of retinol metabolism remarkably attenuated HCC development. We showed that CX3CR1+Ly6C+ macrophages migrate and interact with aHSCs in the peritumoral region where retinoids induce arginase-1 expression in CX3CR1+Ly6C+ macrophages, subsequently depriving CD8+ T cells of arginine and promoting HCC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nDistinct immune microenvironment of venous tumor thrombus in hepatocellular carcinoma at single-cell resolution. \r\nTAMs, especially C5aR+ TAMs, were enriched in PVTT. C5aR+ TAMs contribute to the development of PVTT and poor prognosis by reshaping the immunosuppressive environment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nGenomic and the tumor microenvironment heterogeneity in multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma. \r\nAdditionally, MMP9+ tumor-associated macrophages were enriched across IM and MO, which formed cellular niches with regulatory T cells and proliferative/exhausted T cells. Our findings deeply decipher the heterogeneous TMEs between IM and MO, which provide a comprehensive landscape of multifocal HCC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nHuman-induced pluripotent stem cell-based hepatic modeling of lipid metabolism-associated TM6SF2-E167K variant. \r\nOur findings indicate that induced hepatocytes generated from human-induced pluripotent stem cells carrying the TM6SF2-E167K recapitulate the effects observed in human hepatocytes from individuals with the TM6SF2 mutation. This study characterizes an in vitro model that can be used as a platform to identify potential clinical targets and highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting protein misfolding to alleviate ER stress and mitigate the detrimental effects of the TM6SF2-E167K mutation on hepatic lipid metabolism.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nNon-Invasive Tests: Establishing efficacy for metabolic dysfunction associated steatohepatitis beyond the biopsy-current perspectives from the division of hepatology and nutrition, US Food and Drug Administration. \r\nThis communication is intended to provide some of the regulatory considerations on adopting non-invasive tests in lieu of liver histology as a RLSE in drug development for MASH.

Standardised protocols to ensure robust methodology and allow pooling of large-scale data are required before these findings can be used in clinical practice (PROSPERO  CRD42023431977).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Efficacy and Safety of Tenofovir Alafenamide (TAF) and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF) Followed by TAF in Chronic Hepatitis B Patients of East Asian Ethnicity Following 5 Years of Treatment.\r\nThrough 5 years, rates of virologic suppression were high in East Asian patients treated with TAF or switched from TDF to TAF. TAF and TDF were well tolerated, with improved renal and bone safety observed in patients switching from TDF to TAF.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMetALD: Diagnosis and Prognosis With Non-Invasive Tests.\r\n Widely available NITs are applicable for MetALD, where cut-offs can be used to diagnose advanced fibrosis and predict clinical outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAm J Gastroenterol\r\n    Avoidant/restrictive eating in people with and without bowel symptoms in the general population: Prevalence, Clinical Profile and Associated Factors. \r\nAvoidant/restrictive eating is common in individuals with bowel symptoms and associated with a more severe clinical profile, indicating a need to discuss eating behavior with patients. However, avoidant/restrictive eating is also common in individuals in the general population without bowel symptoms.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCan symptoms and medical history predict outcomes for hydrogen and methane breath testing?\r\n This large questionnaire study demonstrated that IBS-like symptoms, refractory gastroesophageal reflux symptoms, and skin conditions are associated with outcomes on HMBT. These findings support the use of HMBT in accordance with current clinical guidelines.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIncreased mortality associated with sarcopenia in inflammatory bowel disease: a long-term prospective cohort study. \r\nProbable and confirmed sarcopenia increase the risk of long-term mortality in IBD patients. Sarcopenia assessment can help risk stratification for prognosis in older IBD patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSafety of Esophageal Dilation Procedures in Patients on Antithrombotic Therapy: A US Collaborative Network Cohort Study. \r\nDAPT was numerically associated with a higher risk of bleeding, but this did not reach statistical significance. These findings aim to inform the clinical decision-making in pre- and post-procedure management of esophageal dilation procedures.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe impact of integrating pelvic MRI at diagnosis on early detection of perianal Crohn's disease in pediatrics. \r\nThese patients needed more and earlier perianal surgery and had higher biologic use despite their perianal disease being subclinical. Adding routine MR imaging at time of pediatric CD diagnosis may help inform treatment decisions and improve these outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Accelerated vs Step-Up Endoscopic Treatment for Pancreatic Walled-Off Necrosis: A Randomized Controlled Trial (ACCELERATE). \r\n(ClinicalTrials. gov, Number NCT05601687).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nArtificial Intelligence for Quantifying Endoscopic Mucosal Ulceration in Crohn's Disease. \r\nPerformance of CVE for CD was similar in the SEAVUE validation cohort. CVE provides a means for automated ulceration and mucosal injury quantitation that shows conceptual agreement with SES-CD and offers new capabilities to improve the granularity and personalization of endoscopic disease assessment in CD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEffect of five dietary emulsifiers on inflammation, permeability, and the gut microbiome: a placebo-controlled randomized trial.\r\n In this double-blind placebo-controlled exploratory trial, emulsifier supplementation lowered SCFA concentration compared to placebo. Emulsifier supplementation did not impact intestinal or systemic inflammation, or metabolic endpoints. Cholesterol levels decreased after two weeks of EFD. These results point towards potential intestinal benefits of limiting dietary emulsifiers in the diet, requiring further investigation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReal-World Experience of Upadacitinib Reinduction and High Dose Maintenance Therapy in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\n Most patients with IBD who lose response to UPA when dose reduced in maintenance can be recaptured with 45mg QD. Among these, continuing 45mg QD for maintenance is effective, and appears safe.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReal-time use of computer-aided diagnosis in the optical diagnosis of gastric neoplasia: A multicenter randomized controlled trial.\r\n The present CADx assistance did not improve the non-expert optical diagnosis of gastric neoplasia. Further improvements of the CADx with WLI are needed by changing the confidence level cut-off and additional training on easily missed neoplasias. Another option is CADx with magnifying narrow band imaging. (Japan Registry of Clinical Trials, number jRCTs032210171).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReal-world comparison of the effectiveness of tofacitinib and ustekinumab in patients with ulcerative colitis: the TORUS study. \r\nTofacitinib and ustekinumab are similarly effective to induce and maintain CFREM after anti-TNF failure in UC. However, tofacitinib could be favored in case of multiple therapeutic failures (≥ 3 biologics) and primary failure to any biologic.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nWhole-Exome Sequencing-Identified Germline Variants Underlie High Familial Risk and Early-Onset Colorectal Cancer in Taiwan.\r\n These findings improve our understanding of germline genetics in Taiwanese CRC, support better screening and management strategies, and highlight the need to expand Asian variant databases for improved risk assessment and care.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopy\r\n    Efficacy of artificial intelligence for adenoma detection in water exchange colonoscopy: A two-center randomized controlled trial.\r\nFor WE colonoscopy, integrating CADe statistically increased APC without prolonging the withdrawal time or causing a concomitant increase in non-neoplastic lesion resection.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopic management of refractory gastrointestinal-tracheobronchial fistulas with two novel occluders: a comparative cohort study.\r\nAll procedure-related AEs were mild, occurring in five DU (13.9%) and three MU patients (6.0%). The MU occluder showed greater potential for sustained occlusion than the DU occluder and may be a viable option for refractory GI-tracheobronchial fistulas, although further prospective studies are needed.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNational root-cause analysis of 1724 post-colonoscopy colorectal cancers demonstrates avoidable harm.\r\nThis is the largest detailed PCCRC review to date. The majority of PCCRCs were avoidable and caused significant harm. This study clarifies the causes of diagnostic delays and highlights high-risk areas of the colon and high-risk patients, and what needs to be done to reduce PCCRC in the future.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReducing the environmental impact of gastrointestinal endoscopy: a prospective study on waste management through waste segregation and staff education.\r\nTargeted interventions such as staff education and structured waste segregation protocols substantially reduced RMW and associated GHG emissions in a high-volume endoscopy unit.

Standardized reporting could enhance the quality of UGI endoscopy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTraining esophagogastroduodenoscopy skills: a randomized multicenter trial comparing simulation-based training versus clinical training.\r\nSBT prior to CBT reduces the number of supervised procedures required to achieve independent procedural completion without negatively affecting patient satisfaction or increasing training costs. These findings support the routine implementation of SBT when learning EGD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Histologic response is associated with improved esophageal distensibility and symptom burden in pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis.\r\n Histologic remission is associated with improved esophageal distensibility over time in pediatric EoE patients. Baseline esophageal distensibility provides a quantitative marker of tissue remodeling and may help predict disease severity and fibrostenotic progression.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    Clinical impact of combination of lesion-border findings and pit patterns for identifying invasive versus non-invasive neoplastic lesions in ulcerative colitis.\r\nOne hundred and eighteen lesions were classified with distinct borders and 40 with indistinct borders. The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of type II/III pit patterns were intramucosal, suggesting lesions suitable for endoscopic resection.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClinical utility of suprapapillary plastic stents for lifelong biliary drainage in unresectable malignant hilar biliary obstruction. \r\nSPPS, as the first stent for unresectable MHBO, was considered superior to SEMS for the intermittent maintenance of LBD. Achieving LBD success or extending TLBDF may help preserve therapeutic options.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nComparison of endoscopic band ligation versus over-the-scope clip for colonic diverticular bleeding: A propensity score-matched cohort analysis. \r\nNo significant differences in initial hemostasis, requirements for IVR or surgery, requirements of red blood cell transfusion, and adverse events were observed between the two groups. OTSC was more effective than EBL for reducing early recurrent bleeding rate in endoscopic hemostasis for CDB.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nENDOSCOPIC TUNNELED STRICTUROTOMY VERSUS SURGICAL CONVERSION TO ROUX-EN-Y GASTRIC BYPASS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF STENOSIS AFTER SLEEVE GASTRECTOMY.\r\n Endoscopic stricturotomy is a safe, effective alternative for refractory post-LSG stenosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFocused communication Three-dimensional volume estimates of pancreatic fluid collections in relation to clinical outcomes of endoscopic ultrasound-guided treatment. \r\nThe maximum diameter represented a comparable model goodness-of-fit. PFC volume was associated with the outcomes of EUS-guided interventions, and the maximum diameter may be a reasonable surrogate.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOptimal Interval of Screening Endoscopy for Reducing Gastric Cancer Mortality: A Nationwide Cohort Study. \r\nPatients who underwent screening at intervals ≤3 years had a significantly reduced risk of GC-specific mortality compared to those screened at intervals >3 years. A 3-year screening interval may be an effective strategy for high-risk regions.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPerformance comparison of quantitative and qualitative fecal immunochemical tests in community-based colorectal cancer screening. \r\nQnFIT exhibited lower positivity, higher DR at colonoscopy and PPV for CRC over qlFIT. Almost half of colonoscopy resources were saved by qnFIT, although adenoma and polyp were missed in population screening.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    Clinical results of an HBV-specific T-cell receptor-T-cell therapy (SCG101) in patients with HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma treated in an investigator-initiated, interventional trial.\r\n As monotherapy for patients with HBV-HCC, SCG101 demonstrated pronounced antiviral and antitumour activities and a safety profile manageable with supportive care. SCG101's T-cell expansion, serum HBsAg drop and tumour response collectively underscore on-target activity.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGlobal prevalence and gastrointestinal symptom burden of individuals with a history of cholecystectomy.\r\n Cholecystectomy is prevalent worldwide and varies across world regions. A history of this procedure is associated with a higher GI symptom burden, either due to new cholecystectomy-related symptomatic conditions, or persistent DGBI misattributed to biliary disease for which a cholecystectomy was erroneously performed.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nISG15 deficiency in hepatic stellate cells promotes TGFβ2-induced liver fibrosis by counteracting CREB1 ISGylation.\r\nISG15 regulated HSC activation and liver fibrosis in part via the CREB1/TGFβ2/SMAD2 regulatory pathway. Utilisation of ISG15-CREB1 signalling may be a potential therapeutic target for liver fibrosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIntrahepatic donor microbiota-based metataxonomic signature detected in organ preservation solution enables prediction of short-term liver transplant outcomes.\r\n Donor intrahepatic microbial DNA signature predicts LT outcomes via immune-metabolic modulation. While causality requires further study, these findings position the graft microbiome as a novel biomarker and potential therapeutic target, paving the way for microbiome-informed precision care in transplantation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMucosal transcriptomic landscape along the small and large intestines in individuals with and without type 2 diabetes.\r\n Our study offers a detailed mapping of the transcriptomic landscape in the human intestinal tract, demonstrating regionalised gene expression profiles tied to critical biological processes. Notable alterations in immune system activity in the large intestine were observed in individuals with T2D. The publicly available database generated from this study ( provides a valuable resource for exploring the mucosal transcriptome along the human intestinal tract.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    A novel mechanism involving USP53-regulated BSEP trafficking underlies low-GGT intrahepatic cholestasis.\r\nLoss of USP53 interaction with MYO5B and its p.(Arg824Cys) variant impaired BSEP trafficking in USP53- and MYO5B-asociated low-GGT intrahepatic cholestasis. These results provide a novel mechanism that underlies USP53-PFIC and implicates USP53 in the pathogenesis of MYO5B-PFIC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCX3CR1+ macrophages interact with HSCs to promote HCC through CD8+ T-cell suppression. \r\nMoreover, genetic deficiency of CX3CR1 in myeloid cells or pharmacological inhibition of retinol metabolism remarkably attenuated HCC development. We showed that CX3CR1+Ly6C+ macrophages migrate and interact with aHSCs in the peritumoral region where retinoids induce arginase-1 expression in CX3CR1+Ly6C+ macrophages, subsequently depriving CD8+ T cells of arginine and promoting HCC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nDistinct immune microenvironment of venous tumor thrombus in hepatocellular carcinoma at single-cell resolution. \r\nTAMs, especially C5aR+ TAMs, were enriched in PVTT. C5aR+ TAMs contribute to the development of PVTT and poor prognosis by reshaping the immunosuppressive environment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nGenomic and the tumor microenvironment heterogeneity in multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma. \r\nAdditionally, MMP9+ tumor-associated macrophages were enriched across IM and MO, which formed cellular niches with regulatory T cells and proliferative/exhausted T cells. Our findings deeply decipher the heterogeneous TMEs between IM and MO, which provide a comprehensive landscape of multifocal HCC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nHuman-induced pluripotent stem cell-based hepatic modeling of lipid metabolism-associated TM6SF2-E167K variant. \r\nOur findings indicate that induced hepatocytes generated from human-induced pluripotent stem cells carrying the TM6SF2-E167K recapitulate the effects observed in human hepatocytes from individuals with the TM6SF2 mutation. This study characterizes an in vitro model that can be used as a platform to identify potential clinical targets and highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting protein misfolding to alleviate ER stress and mitigate the detrimental effects of the TM6SF2-E167K mutation on hepatic lipid metabolism.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nPlasma FSTL-1 as a noninvasive diagnostic biomarker for patients with advanced liver fibrosis. \r\nA cutoff value ≤ 0.43 ng/mL was the optimal rule-out threshold, with a sensitivity of 84.62% (95% CI, 76.46%-90.30%) and a specificity of 79.51% (95% CI, 74.81%-83.53%), while ≥0.50 ng/mL was the best rule-in threshold, with a specificity of 86.41% (95% CI, 81.06%-90.43%) and a sensitivity of 70.67% (95% CI, 64.41%-76.23%). Plasma FSTL-1 has high diagnostic accuracy and could potentially reduce the need for liver biopsy in identifying patients with advanced liver fibrosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nUse of liver stiffness measurement for hepatocellular carcinoma risk stratification in metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease.\r\nLSM is associated with HCC risk in MASLD. HCC surveillance should be considered in non-cirrhotic MASLD with diabetes and LSM of ≥10 kPa.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nValue of HCC surveillance in a landscape of emerging surveillance options: Perspectives of a multi-stakeholder modified Delphi panel. \r\nThe panel acknowledged performance metrics of emerging methods may differ from other cancer screening programs given differences in populations, including higher risk of cancer development and competing risk of morality, and differences in diagnostic workflow in patients at risk of HCC. These data provide insights into the perceived value of HCC surveillance in an era of emerging blood- and imaging-based surveillance strategies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Decreased LONP1 expression exacerbates MASH-induced liver fibrosis via elevated orotic acid levels.\r\n Our findings demonstrate that the LONP1-DHODH interaction regulates orotic acid metabolism and alleviates MASH-induced liver fibrosis. Impact and implications Liver fibrosis is one of the main histological determinants of MASH, a disease that parallels the worldwide surge in metabolic syndromes. This study reveals that LONP1 links proteolytic surveillance to mitochondrial metabolic rewiring and regulates orotic acid metabolism, contributing to the progression of MASH-induced liver fibrosis. These findings suggest that targeting orotic acid or hepatocyte LONP1 may represent a promising therapeutic strategy. Further investigation into mitochondrial orotic acid metabolism may yield novel insights into the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIdentification and validation of RIPK3 as a novel biomarker to predict outcomes in patients with acutely decompensated cirrhosis.\r\nRIPK3-associated cell death is an important driver of organ failure and mortality in AD/ACLF. Integrating plasma RIPK3 into prognostic models would enhance risk stratification and may guide personalised cell death inhibitor therapy in AD/ACLF patients. Impact and implications Our study underscores the pivotal role of Receptor-Interacting Protein Kinase 3 (RIPK3) as a biomarker in acute decompensation (AD) and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), linking its elevated levels with disease progression, organ dysfunction, and mortality. In liver biopsies, hepatic RIPK1 expression was significantly higher in ACLF than AD and correlated with disease severity and non-survival, supporting their hepatic origin. Through the integration of RIPK3 into predictive models, we provide a path towards personalized therapeutic strategies for AD by targeting necroptosis. This approach has the potential to revolutionize risk stratification, enhance clinical decision-making, and improve outcomes for these high-risk patients.  \r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPhase I trial of ADP-A2AFP TCR T-cell therapy in patients with advanced hepatocellular or gastric hepatoid carcinoma.\r\nLymphodepletion chemotherapy followed by ADP-A2AFP TCR T-cell therapy showed a manageable safety profile and preliminary indications of antitumor activity in these previously treated patients. Impact & implications Adoptive T-cell therapy could be a much-needed additional treatment strategy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Clinicians and researchers interested in the development of adoptive T-cell therapies for advanced solid tumors will be interested to learn that in this phase I trial, ADP-A2AFP T-cell receptor T-cell therapy was associated with an acceptable benefit-to-risk profile and encouraging antitumor activity, illustrating the treatment potential of adoptive T-cell therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

Further validation is required. Clinicaltrials Gov identifier NCT03079427 IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS  Here we performed comprehensive proteogenomic analyses within a prospective randomized trial of patients with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (EH-CCA). The findings highlighted specific genomic and proteomic alterations that were associated with differential benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy regimens. The integration of multiomics data into a machine learning model provides a practical framework for stratifying patients and guiding treatment decisions, which may inform future clinical trials and biomarker-driven therapeutic strategies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Editorial: Cephalosporin-Induced Liver Injury-Interesting but Tricky.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Does Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD) With Advanced Fibrosis Also Equate to Risk of Advanced Coronary Artery Disease?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Dual Advanced Therapy in Refractory Ulcerative Colitis-Hope Beyond Monotherapy.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Intestinal Ultrasound for the Assessment of Constipation-Out of the Shadows?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: PSC as an Independent Risk Factor for CRC Without IBD: Can Observed Epidemiological Trends Help Uncover Biological Mechanisms and Guide Surveillance Strategies? \r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Redefining Decompensation in Cirrhosis-More Than an Academic Playground? \r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Redefining Safety in Post-Liver Transplant IBD-Why Therapeutic Effectiveness Is the Ultimate Shield.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReview Article: Impact of Alcohol Consumption on the Development and Progression of Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease. \r\nAlcohol amplifies MASLD progression through synergistic mechanisms.

In patients with active bleeding from MWTs (oozing and spurting), the panel suggested endoscopic band ligation or endoscopic through-the-scope clip over epinephrine injection alone. For nonbleeding MWTs with visible vessels, adherent clots, flat pigmented spots, or clean-based ulcers, the panel suggested against endoscopic hemostatic therapy. For Dieulafoy's lesions, the panel suggested mechanical modalities with endoscopic band ligation or through-the-scope clip, contact thermocoagulation, or injection of sclerosants over epinephrine injection alone. For patients with gastric antral vascular ectasia, the panel suggested endoscopic band ligation over argon plasma coagulation.

These statements mark the first phase of the EXTENT project, supporting the potential use of IUS in clinical practice and disease modification trials as an alternative tool for bowel damage assessment. The lack of consensus on grade 1 stricturing lesions suggests further exploration of IUS parameters is required.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeta-analysis\r\nmeta-analyses and systematic reviews\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Efficacy and Safety of Vedolizumab and Tofacitinib (VETO) Combination Therapy in Refractory Ulcerative Colitis Unresponsive to Anti-TNF and a Second-Line Advanced Therapy: A Prospective Cohort Nested Within a Randomised Trial.\r\n VETO was effective and safe in patients with UC refractory to anti-TNF and second-line therapies, with over half achieving clinical remission by 24 weeks.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImpact of Frailty on the Prognosis of Patients With Liver Cirrhosis Undergoing Insertion of a TIPS.\r\nTIPS insertion seems to improve physical functioning, as indicated by a decreasing LFI, but only in patients with a poor performance in LFI prior to TIPS. Conducting LFI prior to elective TIPS insertion can identify those with an excellent prognosis. However, frailty should not be considered a contraindication for TIPS.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Fibrosis and the Risk of Coronary Artery Disease, Stent Thrombosis, Restenosis and Adverse Clinical Outcomes.\r\nLiver fibrosis is common among patients with CAD and is associated with CAD incidence, stent thrombosis, restenosis and long-term cardiovascular risk.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAm J Gastroenterol\r\n    988 Lifeline: A Lifesaver for GI Patients Facing Mental Health Challenges.\r\nWe regret any confusion this may have caused.

These results underscored the significance of dietary patterns in preventing MASLD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nUltra-Processed Grains and Risk of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Results from the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) Study.\r\n Higher intake of ultra-processed grains is associated with significantly increased risk of developing IBD. A healthy eating pattern should minimize consumption of ultra-processed grains. Further studies should be performed to understand which components of ultra-processed grains may be detrimental for health.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    A Phase 2 Study of MORF-057, an Oral α4β7 Integrin Inhibitor in Moderately to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis.\r\n Overall, this study demonstrated that oral MORF-057 is well tolerated, with promising efficacy for individuals with moderately to severely active UC. Clinical trial identifier NCT05291689 CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRY WEBSITE \r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nComparative Safety of Janus Kinase inhibitors vs. Tumor Necrosis Factor Antagonists in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.\r\nIn an observational study of patients with IBD, JAK inhibitors were not associated with an increased risk of serious infections, VTE, or MACE compared with TNF antagonists, though the overall risk of infections was higher.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDiagnostic yield of whole exome sequencing in adult-onset cholestatic liver disease.\r\n This study highlights the value of WES in the diagnostic workup of adult-onset cholestatic liver disease and expands our understanding of its genetic landscape, paving the way for larger-scale studies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIdentifying risk factors for metachronous colorectal cancer in Lynch syndrome.\r\nThis study identifies important risk factors for metachronous CRC in LS patients, which may support personalized counseling regarding surgical strategies. The findings highlight the complexity of surgical decision-making and the need for individualized approaches. Further studies are required to refine risk stratification and evaluate long-term outcomes to optimize patient care.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMicrobiological profile of bacterial infections in patients with cirrhosis over time: a 20-year territory-wide study.\r\nAMR is rising in patients with cirrhosis. Multidisciplinary effort is crucial to combat AMR and manage bacterial infections in cirrhosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPreoperative body composition parameters are associated with postoperative outcomes in patients with Crohn's disease.\r\n Preoperative myosteatosis was consistently associated with overall postoperative complications, moderate-to severe, and infectious complications, in patients with CD following ICR. Furthermore, several body composition parameters were identified as risk factor or protective factor for postoperative complications and ePOR. Inconsistent findings were observed for SM levels and ePOR risk. The correlation between improvements of these parameters and postoperative outcomes requires further study.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRepeatability and reproducibility of artificial imaging based digital pathology for the evaluation of liver fibrosis.\r\n The qFibrosis system has good repeatability and reproducibility for fibrosis staging. It can provide an accurate reference for pathologists to stage liver fibrosis more objectively.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Prevalence and Burden of Disorders of Gut-Brain Interaction (DGBI) before versus after the COVID-19 Pandemic.\r\n The population prevalence and burden of DGBI have increased following the COVID-19 pandemic. Healthcare services and research funding bodies need to adapt to this post-COVID rise in DGBI and address how to best manage this patient group.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nUpadacitinib Maintenance Therapy in Crohn's Disease: Final Results From the Randomized Phase 3 U-ENDURE Study.\r\n Consistent with the primary analysis, upadacitinib was more efficacious than placebo in achieving clinical and endoscopic endpoints in patients with Crohn's disease. The safety profile remained consistent with no new safety signals.  Number  NCT03345823.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopy\r\n    A novel colonoscope with 230-degree extra-wide field of view optics: a prospective, first-in-human pilot study.\r\nThis first-in-human study shows that the EFOV colonoscope can be effectively and safely used in clinical practice. It promises improved detection of hidden polyps.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAdded value of a balloon-based mucosal exposure device in computer-aided detection-assisted colonoscopy: a randomized controlled trial (COMBAT study).\r\nIn a FIT-based screening program, adding a balloon-based mucosal exposure device to CADe-assisted colonoscopy did not enhance the detection of subjects with high risk features or of neoplastic lesions. A CADe-related ceiling effect may have limited the benefit of the additional device.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCost-effectiveness of colon capsule endoscopy in colorectal cancer screening: a modeling study.\r\nHowever, these increases came at high financial cost, and CCE cost-effectiveness was dominated by biennial FIT and 10-yearly colonoscopy. CCE was not cost effective for CRC screening compared with biennial FIT and 10-yearly colonoscopy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNumber, depth, and location of inadvertent pancreatic guidewire cannulations and post-ERCP pancreatitis from multi-center real-time intra-procedural data.\r\nSingle main PD duct canulation is independently associated with PEP and appears to be responsible for most of the magnitude of the association with PD cannulation. These data lend additional support to the use of preventative interventions such as PD stenting in cases where the PD is inadvertently cannulated.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTopical hemostatic agents in endoscopy: European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) Technical and Technology Review.\r\nTopical hemostatic agents offer effective options for managing GI bleeding. Products like Purastat, TC-325 Hemospray, EndoClot PHS, Nexpowder, Ankaferd Blood Stopper, and CG GEL have shown promising results in achieving hemostasis;  however, further RCTs and cost-effectiveness analyses are needed to better establish their roles in endoscopic practice.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    A randomized trial of Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection vs Transanal Minimally Invasive Surgery in Early Rectal Neoplasms. DSETAMIS-2018 Study.\r\n ESD appears to be non-inferior to TAMIS for local resection of ERNs regarding 12-month recurrence. Both show favorable safety profiles. ESD was associated with fewer technical constraints, higher procedural success, shorter hospitalization, lower cost, and greater patient acceptance. These results should be interpreted considering the wide non-inferiority margin, limited sample size, and absence of multiplicity adjustment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroNet-5M: A Multicenter Dataset for Developing Foundation Models in Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.\r\n This study presents GastroNet-5M, a dataset of roughly 5 million endoscopic images. Pretraining endoscopic deep learning systems with GastroNet-5M improves diagnostic accuracy, reduces the need for scarce application-specific endoscopic imagery and annotations, and increases their robustness to the inevitable data heterogeneity in clinical practice. This may significantly accelerate development and implementation of endoscopic AI systems. GastroNet-5M is publicly available for scientific use.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLow FODMAP diet improves colonic barrier function and mast cell activation in patients with IBS-D: A mechanistic trial.\r\nIBS-D patients exhibited improvement in colonic barrier dysfunction, mast cell recruitment, and activation post-LFD. FODMAP-mediated barrier dysfunction in IBS-D is mediated by direct activation of the TLR4 receptor on colonic mast cells by fecal LPS.  (NCT04542018).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSelective urokinase inhibition plus chemotherapy: A novel approach to pancreatic cancer treatment via enhanced anti-tumour immunity and decreased metastasis.\r\nBB2-30F-based uPA-targeted therapy is innovative and effectively curtails local tumour growth and metastasis in PDAC mouse models, suggesting the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes. Our findings highlight the role of uPA in PDAC progression, supporting the targeting of uPA protease activity as a promising therapeutic approach for PDAC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    Large-scale profile study on hepatitis B surface antigen levels in chronic hepatitis B: implications for drug development targeting functional cure.\r\nThese patients are unlikely to achieve spontaneous HBsAg seroclearance, but also have suboptimal responses to novel antivirals. Our data has important implications for novel antiviral development.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReal-world impact of implementing lumen-apposing metal stents for pancreatic fluid collections: a nationwide Japanese study.\r\nThe implementation of LAMS was not associated with improved key clinical outcomes but was linked to a higher risk of bleeding and increased healthcare costs. These findings do not support the routine use of LAMS for EUS-guided treatment of al PFCs in standard clinical practice but may restrict it to WON cases with clear indications.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRole of CNNM4 in the progression of cholangiocarcinoma: implications for ferroptosis and therapeutic potential.\r\n This study reveals that increased CNNM4 expression drives CCA progression and malignancy and that its inhibition may be an effective therapeutic strategy to limit proliferation and metastasis in patients with CCA.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTargeting Aurora kinase B regulates cholesterol metabolism and enhances chemoimmunotherapy in cholangiocarcinoma.\r\nAURKB regulates cholesterol levels and immune microenvironment in tumours, highlighting that targeting AURKB or adopting cholesterol-reducing strategy holds promise for CCA treatment, especially in conjunction with first-line chemoimmunotherapy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThrombospondin-2 is a performant biomarker of at-risk MASH and advanced MASH fibrosis in a large multicentre European cohort.\r\nSerum TSP2, alone or with clinical/biological variables, potently discriminates AF and ARM in patients with MASLD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    Pilot trials of oral betaine in participants with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and elevated alanine aminotransferase.\r\n Betaine 8 g/d, 4 g/d, and 2 g/d for 12-24 weeks significantly reduced ALT and other serologic markers of liver injury among participants with clinically defined MASLD and an elevated ALT.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Patient-derived liver organoids recapitulate liver epithelial heterogeneity and enable precision modeling of alcohol-related liver disease.\r\nOverall, we provide a human-based model that captures the epithelial complexity and specific patient features. This approach helps to identify drivers of cell plasticity and expanding organoid-based liver disease modeling for personalized medicine. Impact and implications Here, we describe the generation of biopsy-derived organoids (b-Orgs) from patients with liver disease. b-Orgs capture the liver epithelial cell composition found in patients' liver tissue and are efficiently generated from different stages of the disease, providing a platform for patient-tailored disease modeling and drug testing.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTargeting xanthine oxidoreductase reverses resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.\r\nTargeting XOR-mediated EGFR stabilization and MUC1 upregulation represents a promising therapeutic strategy to inhibit iCCA progression and enhance sensitivity to EGFR TKIs in patients with iCCA. Impact and implications This study identifies XOR as a key driver of resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA), addressing a major limitation of current targeted therapies. By promoting EGFR stability through USP8-mediated deubiquitination and MUC1 upregulation, XOR enhances DNA repair and sustains oncogenic signaling. Inhibition of XOR sensitizes iCCA cells to EGFR TKIs, suppresses tumor progression, and exacerbates DNA damage. These findings suggest that targeting XOR could overcome TKI resistance and offer a novel therapeutic strategy for iCCA, potentially improving outcomes in a patient population with limited effective treatment options.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Editorial: HBV Integration: A Possible Key Driver in the Course of Patients With Chronic HBV Infection Under Viral Suppression.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Toward Safer Pain Management in IBD-Lessons From Prescription Patterns.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Effectiveness and Safety of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation for Recurrent Clostridioides difficile Infection in Immunocompromised Patients.\r\nThe safety and effectiveness outcomes of FMT in mild to moderately immunocompromised populations for recurrent CDI are comparable to those in immunocompetent cohorts.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Presentation of the AGA Distinguished Achievement Award in Basic Science to Eugene B.
