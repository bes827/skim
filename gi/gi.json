OS benefit with STRIDE was improved in participants with disease control. Data suggest that any degree of tumour shrinkage with STRIDE can be associated with improved OS, indicating that conventional response measures may not fully capture STRIDE benefits. Nevertheless, participants experiencing deep responses appear to have the greatest benefit. STRIDE continues to set new benchmarks in uHCC with 1 in 5 patients alive at 5 years. Impact and implications The phase III HIMALAYA study showed that STRIDE (Single Tremelimumab Regular Interval Durvalumab) improved overall survival (OS) versus sorafenib in participants with unresectable HCC (uHCC), including after 4 years of follow-up. Understanding the efficacy and safety of STRIDE over the longer term is important for healthcare providers;  here, we demonstrate that STRIDE sustained an OS benefit versus sorafenib and maintained a manageable safety profile after 5 years of follow-up. OS benefit with STRIDE was improved in participants with disease control and any degree of tumour shrinkage, indicating that conventional response measures may not fully capture the benefits of STRIDE. These findings are important as they set new benchmarks in uHCC and may help guide clinical decisions in the future.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMachine learning based radiomic models outperform clinical biomarkers in predicting outcomes after immunotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma. \r\nThis study used deep learning and machine learning to develop and validate an integrated radiomic-clinical model which can predict survival and response to atezolizumab plus bevacizumab from pre-treatment imaging. Radiomic-based machine learning models can risk-stratify advanced HCC patients receiving atezolizumab plus bevacizumab.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPhosphatidylethanol levels distinguish steatotic liver disease subgroups and are associated with risk of major liver outcomes.\r\nPEth is a valuable alcohol biomarker for distinguishing between SLD subtypes, especially ALD, and predicts adverse outcomes in people with and without SLD. Impact and implications There is controversy regarding the various proposed steatotic liver disease (SLD) subtypes, the most recent definition suggesting that patients with an elevated alcohol consumption and MASLD should be classified as having MetALD. Here, we address this challenge by classifying patients with SLD by utilizing the biomarker phosphatidylethanol (PEth), a direct and reliable biomarker for recent alcohol consumption. Our analysis of this large cohort-comprising 46,406 patients-revealed that using the objective PEth biomarker may be a valuable tool for distinguishing between MASLD and MetALD, and that PEth is strongly associated with the risk of liver outcomes in individuals with and without known SLD. Integrating PEth testing into routine diagnostic evaluations could enhance knowledge on the underlying pathophysiology in SLD, reduce the potential for misclassification, and ultimately improve patient outcomes by enabling clinicians to offer appropriate therapies. Further research is needed to validate these findings in other populations and to explore the potential integration of PEth into broader clinical guidelines for managing SLD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRegulation of KIF23 by miR-107 controls replicative tumor cell fitness in mouse and human hepatocellular carcinoma.\r\nDisruption of the miR-107/Kif23 axis inhibited hepatoma cell proliferation in vitro and prevented oncogene-induced liver cancer development in vivo, offering a novel potential avenue for the treatment of HCC in humans. Impact and implications Our study revealed the central role of the miR-107/KIF23 axis in controlling tumor cell fitness and hepatocellular carcinoma progression. The results demonstrate that the overexpression of miR-107 or silencing of its target, KIF23, markedly suppresses the proliferation, survival, and motility of human and mouse hepatoma cells. In this work, we demonstrate that the disruption of miR-107/Kif23 signaling effectively protects mice from an aggressive form of oncogene-induced liver cancer in vivo, implying that targeting miR-107/KIF23 might be a novel therapeutic approach for hepatocellular carcinoma in humans.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTumor-Derived CD109 Orchestrates Reprogramming of Tumor-Associated Macrophages to Dampen Immune Response.\r\nOur findings reveal sCD109 as a 'secreted immune checkpoint' that reprograms the TIME and suggest that CD109 inhibition is a valuable strategy to sensitize the effectiveness of iCCA immunotherapy. Impact and implications Poor response to tumor immunotherapy in patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) has long been a challenge for clinicians. In this study, we used multiomics approaches to elucidate that tumor cells secrete soluble CD109, which reprograms macrophages, leading to the accumulation of CD73 + macrophages in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). This effect significantly inhibits T cell proliferation and the immune response of CD8 + T cells, thereby impairing the efficacy of immunotherapy. In preclinical studies, we demonstrated that targeting CD109 in mice can markedly improve the immunosuppressive TIME, sensitizing iCCA cells to anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy. These findings represent a crucial step toward developing more effective therapies for iCCA and have significant implications for clinicians, scientists, and drug developers in the field.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nValidation and expansion of Baveno VII recompensation criteria in patients with cirrhosis and curable liver disease.\r\n Baveno-VII criteria identify cirrhotic patients with a good prognosis, but fewer than 10% of decompensated patients achieve recompensation. Expanding these criteria to include patients receiving minimal decompensation treatment identifies those with similarly low mortality risk. Impact and implications In recent years, growing evidence has shown that achieving an etiological cure can significantly improve the prognosis of decompensated patients, leading to the development of the concept of recompensation. Baveno VII recently proposed a definition for recompensation;  however, data on the clinical impact of this condition remain limited. In this study we evaluated Baveno VII criteria and developed and validated expanded Baveno VII criteria for recompensation. Our findings demonstrates that recompensation is associated with improved survival, reduced hyperdynamic circulation and decreased systemic inflammation in outpatients with decompensated cirrhosis. These results are valuable for hepatologists and researchers aiming to refine patient management strategies and risk stratification in cirrhosis care.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Editorial: Carvedilol Remains the First-Line Treatment of Portal Hypertension After the CALIBRE Trial.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Real-World Evidence of Upadacitinib-An Effective Induction Therapy for Crohn's Disease?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: When and What to Ask-Capturing the Symptoms Experienced by Patients With PSC.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Artificial Intelligence for Clinical Trial Facilitation, Lessons for Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Scoping Review.\r\nNotwithstanding the ethical, regulatory, and practical limitations, incorporation of AI into clinical trials may accelerate and improve quality of drug development in IBD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Acute Pancreatitis in Children: It's Not Just a Simple Attack.\r\nOur review highlights for the first time how AP can lead to significant long-term sequelae, including exocrine/nutritional deficiencies, endocrine pancreatic dysfunction, diabetes, recurrent pain, and decreased quality of life compared to healthy population controls.

Our study highlights the importance of monitoring dynamic changes at the protein and organelle levels during anticancer treatment, providing robust evidence for functional precision oncology. Impact and implications This study identifies that high INF2 expression at baseline is associated with poor prognosis in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) patients. Moreover, cisplatin-induced INF2 degradation via proteasomal and SEC62-mediated ER-phagy is revealed as a key driver of mitochondrial hyperfusion and chemoresistance in CCA. It establishes mitochondrial morphology targeting as a novel strategy to overcome chemotherapy resistance. Furthermore, this study emphasizes the need to focus on dynamic changes in tumor proteins or organelle functions during treatment (functional precise oncology), rather than limiting analysis to static tumor states. Given that inhibition of oncogenes may lead to potential resistance mechanisms, comprehensive preclinical evaluations are essential before clinical application.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Neurogastroenterol Motil\r\n    Association Between Caffeine Intake and Stool Frequency- or Consistency-Defined Constipation: Data From the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005-2010. \r\nCaffeine consumption is not associated with stool frequency or consistency-defined constipation.

Many PPCRCs were diagnosed after recommended exam, suggesting the need to improve patient adherence to recommended surveillance intervals.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastric (Foveolar) Dysplasia in Barrett's Esophagus: A Clinical, Molecular and Long-Term Outcome Study.\r\n Gastric type dysplasia is common in BE. Our study suggests that this type of dysplasia may represent a more aggressive form of neoplastic precursor than conventional intestinal type dysplasia.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIncidence and survival of colorectal cancer in the United Kingdom from 2000-2021: a population-based cohort study.\r\n Although the overall incidence in the population has plateaued, a worrying increasing trend of early-onset CRC was observed. Moreover, the slight improvement in overall survival suggests that significant progress is still needed. These findings highlight the urgent need for continued research and resource allocation to improve the diagnosis and management of colorectal cancer.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Cleansing Imposters: An Analysis Of Popular Online Liver Supplements.\r\nThis study reveals a thriving market for liver supplements despite limited scientific evidence supporting their efficacy. The prevalence of bold health claims, high consumer satisfaction, and significant sales highlight the need for more rigorous evaluation and regulation of these products. Healthcare providers should be aware of these trends to better counsel patients on evidence-based approaches to liver health.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLoss of response to off-label swallowed topical corticosteroids in eosinophilic esophagitis can be overcome by a switch to an esophageal-targeted budesonide formulation.\r\n Most patients non-responding to olSTC are not true corticosteroid-refractory but respond to an esophageal-targeted budesonide formulation. Age below 30 years, longer treatment duration and low adherence are associated with olSTC-failure.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRaising the age for starting colonoscopy to 35 years for individuals with path_MSH6 carriers may lead to missed opportunities for detecting advanced neoplasia in a notable percentage of carriers.\r\n Our findings suggest that the recommendation to raise the age for initiating colonoscopy to 35 years for path_MSH6 carriers merits careful consideration, as there is a possibility that AN may not be detected. Given the limited size of our study and the potential for ascertainment bias, we encourage further research to explore and validate our findings.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRisk of Colorectal Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection in Older Adults: A Nationwide Study in Japan.\r\nThe risks of AEs during colorectal ESD increase with age, particularly in patients aged ≥85 years.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSafety and Efficacy of Endoscopic Retrograde Appendicitis Therapy for pediatric patients: A Single-Center Retrospective Study in Chinese Children.\r\nERAT appears to be a safe and effective alternative approach to treat appendicitis in pediatric patients, especially for obstructive appendicitis with appendicolith.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTraining and Performance of an Electrocardiogram-enabled Machine Learning Model for Detection of Advanced Chronic Liver Disease.\r\n An ECG-enabled ML model affords great promise in identifying advanced CLD in low resource areas.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopy\r\n    Peroral endoscopic myotomy for symptomatic blown-out myotomy following previous myotomy for achalasia.\r\nClinical success was equivalent between the two groups at the 2-year follow-up (85.7% vs 92.3%;  = 0.16). Based on this study, POEM could be considered as an effective treatment option for patients with symptomatic BOM.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nProton pump inhibitors are associated with occlusion of lumen-apposing metal stents and higher frequency of endoscopic necrosectomies - A European-wide multicenter cohort study.\r\n Intake of PPIs upon LAMS placement is associated with a higher LAMS occlusion and necrosectomy rate.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    AI-Enabled Clinical Trials in IBD: Automating and Enhancing Disease Assessment and Study Management.\r\nLarge language models and generative AI are automating the collection of high-quality data from electronic records and improving our ability to predict patient outcomes.

Use of IUS monitoring antenatally should be considered to guide therapeutic decision making.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nStromal Stiffness-Regulated IGF2BP2 in Pancreatic Cancer Drives Immune Evasion via Sphingomyelin Metabolism.\r\n These findings emphasize the critical interplay between extrinsic matrix stiffness and intrinsic IGF2BP2-regulated sphingomyelin synthesis, identifying a promising target for immunotherapeutic strategies in PDAC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    Risk of post-ERCP pancreatitis due to placement of biliary self-expandable metal stents (SEMS): a single-center retrospective study.\r\nAt our center, SEMS placement was found to be an independent risk factor for the development of PEP.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    Combining faecal haemoglobin, iron deficiency anaemia status and age can improve colorectal cancer risk prediction in patients attending primary care with bowel symptoms: a retrospective observational study.\r\n Combining f-Hb, patient age and IDA status improves CRC risk prediction, identifies a low-risk group with f-Hb<20 µg Hb/g and no IDA and could inform revised referral guidance.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nStressed hepatocyte sustains alcohol-associated hepatitis progression by producing leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 2.\r\n Our studies identified a novel vicious cycle between neutrophils and hepatocytes through the LECT2-PHB2 interaction, presenting a promising therapeutic intervention by targeting LECT2 to mitigate AH in patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTumour-intrinsic alterations and stromal matrix remodelling promote Wnt-niche independence during diffuse-type gastric cancer progression.\r\nOur findings demonstrate that tumour cell-derived ligand expression and extracellular matrix remodelling sustain Wnt signalling during DGC progression. These complementary mechanisms promote niche independence enabling expansion of undifferentiated DGC cells needed for the development of advanced tumours.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    Comparative effectiveness of immunotherapy versus lenvatinib in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: A real-world analysis using target trial emulation.\r\nIn this real-world analysis, immunotherapy was associated with improved OS compared to lenvatinib in advanced HCC, with consistent benefit across most subgroups. These findings support the use of immunotherapy as a first-line treatment for advanced HCC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEpidemiological and economical burden of cholestatic liver disease.\r\nAn accurate understanding of the epidemiology and burden of disease on both the individual and society of cholestatic diseases is of great importance. This review aims at providing a comprehensive overview of the current literature on the epidemiology, health related quality of life, and economical burden of PSC, PBC, and IgG4-C.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGetting to HBV Cure - will new biomarkers help?\r\nIn this review, the serological, virological and immunological biomarkers are described with a focus on how they can be used to guide development of HBV cure strategies. New terminology is proposed for clinical endpoints, including Sustained Control to replace the concept of partial cure and Resolved Chronic Infection to replace Functional Cure, reserving the term Cure for clearance or silencing of al cccDNA and integrated HBV DNA.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Cause-specific mortality in 13,099 patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease in Sweden.\r\nMASLD was strongly associated with liver- and HCC-related mortality, but the absolute risks of death were highest for non-HCC cancer and cardiovascular disease. Mortality was increased for nearly al causes in patients with MASLD, suggesting that earlier multidisciplinary care is needed to reduce excess mortality. Impact and implications Previous studies on mortality in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) were either small, restricted to liver-related mortality, relying on liver biopsy to identify patients and thus inducing selection bias, or mainly using data from old cohorts. In a nationwide cohort study of al patients diagnosed with MASLD in inpatient or specialized outpatient care in Sweden between 2002 and 2020, we found a nearly doubled all-cause mortality rate and higher mortality than the general population from a wide range of causes, indicating that earlier multidisciplinary care may be needed to reduce premature mortality in patients with MASLD. The absolute risk estimates of death in our study may be useful for clinicians and policymakers to inform patients about their prognosis and potentially implement clinical or public health strategies to reduce premature mortality.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHealth-related quality of life in participants with advanced biliary tract cancer from the randomized phase III KEYNOTE-966 study.\r\n HRQoL was maintained after adding pembrolizumab to gemcitabine and cisplatin, further supporting this regimen as first-line treatment for advanced BTC. Impact and implications Biliary tract cancer (BTC) is often diagnosed at late stages because most patients do not present with disease-specific symptoms. Compared with the general population, patients with advanced BTC report worse physical, emotional, and functional well-being. In KEYNOTE-966, adding the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor pembrolizumab to gemcitabine and cisplatin as first-line therapy for participants with advanced BTC produced a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival. The prespecified patient-reported outcomes results from KEYNOTE-966 presented herein demonstrated that health-related quality of life was maintained after adding pembrolizumab to gemcitabine and cisplatin, further supporting this regimen as first-line treatment for advanced BTC.

Differences in safety profiles underscore the relevance of ethnicity for nal-IRI in patients with BTC. Impact and implications Current standard of care for second-line therapy in patients with advanced biliary tract cancer (BTC) is FOLFOX. This study provides robust evidence supporting the potential role of additional liposomal irinotecan (nal-IRI) to fluorouracil and leucovorin (5-FU/LV) as a subsequent therapy for patients with BTC who have progressed on gemcitabine-based regimens. The findings demonstrate significant improvements in progression-free survival and overall response rates, emphasizing its potential to address the limited treatment options in this patient population. Furthermore, the study underscores the necessity of considering ethnic differences in adverse event profiles to optimize treatment administration and patient outcomes.
