BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: Understand the endoscopy suite's electrosurgical generator settings appropriate for polypectomy or postpolypectomy thermal techniques.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Improved assessment of donor liver steatosis using Banff consensus recommendations and deep learning algorithms.\r\nOur findings support the use of Banff recommendations in daily practice and highlight the need for a granular analysis of their effect on liver transplantation outcomes. Impact and implications • We developed and validated the first automated deep-learning algorithms for steatosis standardized assessment based on the Banff Liver Working Group consensus recommendations. • Our algorithm provides an unbiased automated evaluation of steatosis, which will lay the groundwork for granular analysis of steatosis's short- and long-term effects on organ viability to identify clinically relevant steatosis cut-off for donor organ acceptance. • Implementing our algorithm in daily clinical practice will allow a more efficient and safe allocation of donor organs, aiming at improving the post-transplant outcomes of patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeta-analysis\r\nmeta-analyses and systematic reviews\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Gastroenterol\r\n    Dye Chromoendoscopy Outperforms High-Definition White Light Endoscopy in Dysplasia Detection for IBD Patients: An Updated Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.\r\n Our updated meta-analysis supports DCE as a superior strategy in overall dysplasia detection in IBD, even with HD scopes. When expertise is available, DCE should be considered for surveillance colonoscopy in high-risk IBD patients, with the acknowledgment that virtual chromoendoscopy shows equivalence in recent studies. Further multicenter trials with multiple endoscopists with varying expertise levels and longer-term outcome data showing a reduction in cancer or cancer-related death are needed.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndosc Int Open\r\n    Colorectal endoscopic submucosal dissection in the West: A systematic review and meta-analysis.\r\nThe effectiveness of colorectal ESD for large colorectal polyps and early colorectal cancers is improving in Western countries, and recent resection rates are comparable to that seen in Asia. Colorectal perforation is still observed in about 5% of ESD;  however, < 2% of patients need emergency surgery for AEs.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Bifidobacterium breve Bif195 ameliorates aspirin-induced gastric mucosal damage: A randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial.\r\nBif195 reduces aspirin-induced gastric mucosal damage and may serve as a safe supplement during multiple-dosing aspirin treatment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClinical trial: Clinical and endoscopic outcomes with ustekinumab in patients with Crohn's disease: Results from the long-term extension period of STARDUST.\r\n STARDUST LTE is the first interventional ustekinumab efficacy study to show a favourable benefit-risk profile with preservation of clinical and endoscopic outcomes through Week 104 using flexible, algorithm-driven dose adjustment including de-escalation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEfficacy and safety of upadacitinib for 16-week extended induction and 52-week maintenance therapy in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis.\r\nPatients without clinical response after 8 weeks' upadacitinib 45 mg induction therapy, may benefit from an additional 8 weeks of therapy. Clinical trial registration\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLong-term effectiveness and acceptability of switching from intravenous to subcutaneous infliximab in patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with intensified doses: The REMSWITCH-LT study.\r\nSwitching from IV to SC infliximab 120 mg every other week is safe and well accepted leading to low long-term risk of relapse. Tight monitoring and dose escalation should be recommended for patients receiving 10 mg/kg/6 weeks and 4 weeks, respectively.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLongitudinal changes in renal function in patients with chronic hepatitis B on antiviral treatment.\r\nNUC-treated patients, especially those on TDF, faced a higher CKD progression risk than untreated patients. Entecavir- and TAF-treated patients had comparable CKD progression risks to untreated patients. No difference was observed between entecavir and TAF in the risk of CKD progression.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAm J Gastroenterol\r\n    Psychiatric and educational aspects of familial adenomatous polyposis - a nationwide Danish cohort study with matched non-exposed individuals.\r\n Compared to non-exposed individuals, FAP patients had significantly less education and an increased risk of developing mood and behavioural disorders, with an increased likelihood of needing antidepressants and antipsychotics.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Chronic Liver Disease and Cirrhosis Mortality Rates are Disproportionately Increasing in Younger Women in the US between 2000-2020.\r\n Mortality rates due to CLD and cirrhosis in the U.S. are increasing disproportionately in younger women. This finding was driven by higher rates in Non-Hispanic White and Hispanic individuals, with variation between U.S. states. Future studies are warranted to identify the reasons for these trends with the ultimate goal of improving outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nProlonged gastrointestinal manifestations after recovery from COVID-19.\r\nIn this follow-up survey of patients 12-18 months after hospitalization with COVID-19, there was a high prevalence of DGBIs and persistent GI symptoms. Prolonged gastrointestinal manifestations were associated with the severity of GI symptoms during hospitalization and with the degree of psychological trauma related to the illness experience.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndosc Int Open\r\n    Duodenal neuroendocrine tumors: Short-term outcomes of endoscopic submucosal dissection performed in the Western setting.\r\nIn experienced hands, ESD for D-NETs can achieve a 100% en bloc resection rate. There were no cases of local recurrence or distant metastatic spread, indicating that ESD may be a viable option for patients with D-NETs 10 to 15 mm that are not surgical candidates.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nPilot study of an endoluminal-suturing device as a treatment for patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease.\r\nEndoscopic full-thickness suturing of the esophagogastric junction with the Endomina suturing platform is feasible, allowing persistence of two-thirds of the plications, with promising results for decreasing reflux and improving GERD symptoms.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nPotential role of a novel endoscopic retrieval bag for large colorectal resected specimen: a proof-of-concept study.\r\nThe median (interquartile range) retrieval time was 4 (4-8) minutes, and no apparent adverse events were observed. The novel Endo Carry Large Type device can accomplish colorectal specimen retrieval safely and quickly without specimen damage and therefore may contribute to accurate pathological diagnosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Cholangiocytes modulate CD100 expression in the liver and facilitate pathogenic Th17 differentiation.\r\nCD100 exerts its functional impact through cholangiocyte-immune cell crosstalk and underscores an active, proinflammatory role of cholangiocytes that can be relevant to novel treatment approaches.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nProteomic characterization identifies clinically relevant subgroups of gastrointestinal stromal tumors.\r\nOur study provides a valuable data resource and highlights potential therapeutic approaches for GIST.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRET Signaling Persists in the Adult Intestine and Stimulates Motility by Limiting PYY Release from Enteroendocrine Cells.\r\nRET signaling normally limits nutrient-dependent peptide release from L-cells and this activity is necessary for normal intestinal motility in male mice. These effects could contribute to dysmotility in HSCR, which predominantly affects males, and uncovers a mechanism that could be targeted to treat post-prandial GI dysfunction.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Effect of Nationwide Organized Cancer Screening Programs on Gastric Cancer Mortality: a Synthetic Control Study.\r\n South Korea's nationwide GC screening has apparent benefits while the Japanese program's effectiveness is uncertain.

There is large uncertainty in HDV prevalence. The implementation of reflex testing would improve estimates, while also allowing earlier linkage to care for HDV-RNA-positive individuals. The logistical and economic burden of reflex testing on the health system would be limited, as it would only screen HBsAg+ cases. Impact and implications There is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the prevalence of HDV among people living with HBV at the population level. This study aimed to better understand the burden in 25 countries and territories, to refine techniques that can be used in future analyses. We found a lower prevalence in the majority of places studied than had been previously reported. These data can help inform policy makers on the need to screen people living with HBV to find those coinfected with HDV and at high risk for progression, while also highlighting the pitfalls that other researchers have often fallen into.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Neurogastroenterol Motil\r\n    The Prevalence and Characteristics of Symptomatic Uncomplicated Diverticular Disease Among Asian Patients With Unexplained Abdominal Symptoms.\r\nIt is important to recognize that patients with SUDD account for as high as 31% of outpatients with unexplained abdominal symptoms;  these patients have diarrhea and a low QOL. The presence of right-sided SUDD was characteristic of Asian patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the publisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    American Indian and Alaska Native Digestive Health: Challenges, Opportunities, and a Path Forward.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nBlue Notes.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndosc Int Open\r\n    Drainage of walled-off necrosis: when can I still use plastic stents?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Too Much of a Good Thing: Imposing an Upper Limit to a High Fiber Diet.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Detour of bile acids routes as therapeutic roadmap for cholemic nephropathy.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nE. coli´s fight against TYROnny: Designing a bacterial strain to tackle tyrosinemia type 1.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nUsing NIS2+™ to identify at-risk MASH in clinical trials.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous\r\nmisc publications eg case reports, tools of the trade, images of the month, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Gastroenterol\r\n    Calendar of Courses, Symposiums and Conferences.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nChatGPT and American College of Gastroenterology Self-Assessment Test: Comment.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nComments on Quality of Life in Patients With Definite Chronic Pancreatitis: A Nationwide Longitudinal Cohort Study.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGenerative Artificial Intelligence for Gastroenterology: Neither Friend nor Foe.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIdentifying Phenotypic Determinants of Infliximab Target Concentrations in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Toward Personalized Evidence-Based Dosing Regimens.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLooking to Future Applications of Large Language Models.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nResponse to Bourgonje and Mian.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nResponse to Yi et al.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Adenomyomatous hyperplasia of the ampulla of Vater.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndosc Int Open\r\n    Basket-assisted method for removal of floating pancreatic stones by electronic hydraulic lithotripsy through peroral pancreatoscopy.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nEndoscopy\r\n    Colonoscopy setting and impact on statistical significance in Artificial Intelligence trials.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDiagnosis and preoperative evaluation of vena cava mass by endoscopic ultrasound: \"hunting\" for the overlooked lesions.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nEndoscopy E-Videos -

HDV-infected patients had high rates of baseline liver complications and other comorbidities at time of diagnosis, suggesting potentially delayed diagnosis and/or treatment. Earlier identification of HBV/HDV infection among the HBV population may provide opportunities to improve linkage to care and treatment, thereby reducing the risk of liver-related morbidity and mortality.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSingle-cell dissection of the multicellular ecosystem and molecular features underlying microvascular invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma.\r\nThis study provides a comprehensive single-cell atlas of MVI in HCC, shedding light on the complex multicellular ecosystem and molecular features associated with MVI.

Impact and implications Our study describe for the first time the myeloid cell landscape in human visceral adipose tissue at single cell level within a cohort of well-characterised NAFLD patients. We report unique NASH-specific transcriptional changes within metabolically active macrophages (MMacs) and resident vasculature-associated macrophages (ResVAM) and we demonstrate their spatial location surrounding the vasculature. These dysfunctional transcriptional macrophage states, coincided with the loss of adipose tissue vascular integrity, providing a strong plausible mechanism by which tissue inflammation is perpetuated in adipose tissue and downstream in the liver. Our study provide a theoretical basis for new therapeutic strategies to be directed towards reinstating ResVAM and MMac endogenous metabolic and homeostatic and cytoprotective mechanisms including their function to protect the vascular integrity and barrier.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAssociation between public health policies on alcohol and worldwide cancer, liver disease and cardiovascular disease outcomes.\r\nThe API is a valuable instrument to quantify the robustness of alcohol-related PHP establishment.

Hepatotoxicity leads to discontinuation in 7% of patients with HCC and does not negatively affect oncological outcomes. Impact and implications Immune-related liver injury (irLI) is common in patients with cancer receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), but whether irLI is more frequent or it is associated with a worse clinical course in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), compared to other tumours, is not known. Herein, we compared characteristics and outcomes of irLI in two prospective cohorts including patients treated with ICIs for HCC or for other oncological indications. irLI is significantly more common and it occurs earlier in patients with HCC, also after adjustment for duration of treatment exposure. However, outcomes of patients with HCC who developed irLI are not negatively affected in terms of requirement of corticosteroid therapy, hepatic decompensation, treatment discontinuation and overall survival.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nConvergent MAPK pathway alterations mediate acquired resistance to FGFR inhibitors in FGFR2 fusion-positive cholangiocarcinoma.\r\nThese findings suggest convergent genomic evolution in the MAPK pathway may be a potential mechanism of acquired resistance to FGFRi. Impact and implications We evaluated tumors and plasma from patients who previously received inhibitors of Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR), an important receptor that plays a role in cancer cell growth, especially in tumors with abnormalities in this gene such as FGFR fusions, where the FGFR gene is fused to another gene, leading to activation of cancer cell growth. We found that patients treated with FGFR inhibitors may develop mutations in other genes such as KRAS, and this can confer resistance to FGFR inhibitors. Clinical trial number NCT02052778.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGlobal survey of stigma among physicians and patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.\r\nPerception of NAFLD stigma varies among patients, providers, geographic locations and sub-specialties. - Despite the increasing burden of NAFLD and the fact that over 38% of the world's adult population have NAFLD, disease awareness remains low. One potential issue that may affect awareness is the stigma associated with the terms, \"non-alcoholic\" and \"fatty\". In this global study, we found that the terms patients and physicians thought to cause stigma were different. These differences may negatively affect provider-patient communication hindering prompt intervention. These results can help inform education about this liver disease especially as the new nomenclature of Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD) is being implemented. Impact and implications Over the past decades, efforts have been underway to change the nomenclature of NAFLD to better align with its underlying pathogenetic pathways and remove any potential stigma associated with the name. Given the paucity of data related to stigma in NAFLD, we undertook this global comprehensive survey to assess stigma in NAFLD among patients and providers from around the world. We found there is a disconnect between physicians and patients related to stigma and related nomenclature. With this knowledge, educational programs can be developed to better target stigma in NAFLD among al stakeholders and to provide a better opportunity for the new nomenclature to address the issues of stigma.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRedox-Sensitive High-Mobility Group Box-1 Isoforms Contribute To Liver Fibrosis Progression And Resolution In Mice.\r\nMethods & results Using electrospray ionization-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (ESI-LC-MS), we identified that disulfide ([O]) and sulfonated ([SO ] HMGB1 could point at 'resolution under way'.

EcN-HT represents a novel engineered probiotic with the potential to treat this condition. Impact and implications Patients with hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1) is characterized by an inability to metabolize tyrosine normally and suffer from liver failure, renal dysfunction, neurological impairments, and cancer. Given the overlap and complementarity between the host and microbial metabolic pathways, the gut microbiome provides a potential chance to regulate host metabolism through degradation of tyrosine and reduction of byproducts that might be toxic. Here, we demonstrated that an engineered live bacterium, EcN-HT, could enhance tyrosine breakdown, reduce the accumulation of toxic tyrosine byproducts, and protect against lethal liver injury in Fah-knockout mice. These findings suggested that engineered live biotherapeutics that can degrade tyrosine in the gut may represent a viable and secure strategy for the prevention of lethal liver injury in HT1 as well as the mitigation of its associated pathologies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCharacteristics and outcomes of immunotherapy-related liver injury in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma versus other advanced solid tumours.\r\nDespite higher incidence and earlier onset in patients with HCC, IrLI is characterised by high rates of remission, low requirement for corticosteroid therapy and low risk of decompensation compared to other solid tumours. Hepatotoxicity leads to discontinuation in 7% of patients with HCC and does not negatively affect oncological outcomes. Impact and implications Immune-related liver injury (irLI) is common in patients with cancer receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), but whether irLI is more frequent or it is associated with a worse clinical course in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), compared to other tumours, is not known. Herein, we compared characteristics and outcomes of irLI in two prospective cohorts including patients treated with ICIs for HCC or for other oncological indications. irLI is significantly more common and it occurs earlier in patients with HCC, also after adjustment for duration of treatment exposure. However, outcomes of patients with HCC who developed irLI are not negatively affected in terms of requirement of corticosteroid therapy, hepatic decompensation, treatment discontinuation and overall survival.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nConvergent MAPK pathway alterations mediate acquired resistance to FGFR inhibitors in FGFR2 fusion-positive cholangiocarcinoma.\r\nThese findings suggest convergent genomic evolution in the MAPK pathway may be a potential mechanism of acquired resistance to FGFRi. Impact and implications We evaluated tumors and plasma from patients who previously received inhibitors of Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR), an important receptor that plays a role in cancer cell growth, especially in tumors with abnormalities in this gene such as FGFR fusions, where the FGFR gene is fused to another gene, leading to activation of cancer cell growth. We found that patients treated with FGFR inhibitors may develop mutations in other genes such as KRAS, and this can confer resistance to FGFR inhibitors.

Impact and implications In this study, we revealed a novel mechanism that the balance of Gata3 and Ramp2 in hepatocyte regulated hepatic vascular reconstitution via shifting PEDF to VEGFA during hepatectomy- or ALLPS-induced liver regeneration. We also identified serum PEDF/VEGFA index (SPVI) as a potential predictor for post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) in patients who underwent hepatectomy. This study will provide a better understanding on how hepatocytes contribute to liver regeneration and new targets for the prevention and treatment of PHLF.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInhibition of the Renal Apical Sodium Dependent Bile Acid Transporter Prevents Cholemic Nephropathy in Mice with Obstructive Cholestasis.\r\nBA enrichment in proximal TEC followed by oxidative stress and cell death is an early key event in CN. Inhibiting renal ASBT and consequently BA enrichment in TEC prevents CN and systemically decreases BA concentrations. Impact and implications Cholemic nephropathy (CN) is a severe complication of cholestasis with an unmet clinical need for therapy. We demonstrate that CN is triggered by the renal accumulation of bile acids (BA)- that are considerably increased in the systemic blood. Specifically, the proximal tubular epithelial cells (TEC) of the kidney take up BA via the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT). We developed a therapeutic compound that blocks ASBT in the kidneys, prevents BA overload in TEC, and almost completely abolished al disease hallmarks in a CN mouse model. Renal ASBT inhibition represents a potential therapeutic strategy for CN patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJAK1 promotes HDV replication and is a potential target for antiviral therapy.\r\nTaken together, we uncovered JAK1 as a key host factor for HDV replication and a potential target for new antiviral treatment. Impact and implications Chronic hepatitis D is the most aggressive form of chronic viral hepatitis with no curative treatment. New therapeutic strategies based on host targeting agents are urgently needed. Here, using loss-of-function strategies, we uncover an unexpected interaction between JAK1, a major actor of the innate antiviral response, and HDV infection. We demonstrated that JAK1 kinase activity is crucial for both the phosphorylation of the delta antigen and the replication of the virus. By demonstrating the antiviral potential of several FDA-approved JAK1 inhibitors, our results could pave the way to the development of innovative therapeutic strategies to tackle this global health threat.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the publisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Assessing risk of index serrated polyps.\r\nThe most recent US Multi Society Task Force (USMSTF) for Colorectal Cancer (CRC) post-polypectomy guidelines recommend surveillance intervals for sessile serrated lesions (SSLs) based on size, dysplasia, and number of index polyps. 1 Large (>1 cm) hyperplastic polyps (HPs), which previously had a 10 year follow-up recommendation, now have a 3-5 year interval, 2 However, most of the serrated polyp recommendations were based on low quality evidence, underscoring the need for more data.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Evolving Landscape of Colorectal Cancer Screening and Colonoscopy Practice: Insights from the Japan Polyp Study.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Toward quantification of H. pylori-associated gastric cancer risk: Further evidence supporting development of population-based strategies for H. pylori eradication.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    Getting off tract: contributions of intraorgan microbiota to cancer in extraintestinal organs.\r\nThese habitats are challenging to sample, and their low microbial biomass among large amounts of host tissue can make study challenging.
