The majority screened had osteopenia or osteoporosis on DEXA scan. Less than a quarter of patients with osteoporosis were started on treatment. Real-world experience of oral bisphosphonate use did not reveal higher rates of gastrointestinal bleeding. There is room for improvement in al aspects of bone health care in cirrhosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAm J Gastroenterol\r\n    Long-term natural history of autoimmune gastritis: results from a prospective, monocentric series.\r\nAIG is a progressive disorder, with a virtually absent risk of gastric adenocarcinoma. Potential AIG patients should be monitored as they carry a high risk of evolving into overt AIG.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe efficacy of metoclopramide for gastric visualization by endoscopy in patients with active upper gastrointestinal bleeding: double-blind randomized controlled trial.\r\n Metoclopramide did not improve endoscopic visualization but decreased the need for second look EGD in patients with overall active UGIB. It improved gastric visualization in those with UGIB due to gastric lesions, primarily by improving visualization in the fundus. (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT04771481).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Accuracy of the enhanced liver fibrosis test in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and its clinical implications.\r\n The high diagnostic performance of the ELF test for predicting advanced fibrosis in individuals with or without T2DM could address an unmet medical need for accurate assessment of liver fibrosis in patients with diabetes and NAFLD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCardiovascular Safety of Ozanimod in Patients With Ulcerative Colitis: True North and Open-Label Extension Analyses.\r\nNo new cardiovascular safety signals were identified, consistent with findings from previous ozanimod studies. There were few major adverse cardiovascular events or thromboembolic events, which were unrelated or unlikely related to ozanimod. Ozanimod has a well-tolerated cardiovascular safety profile when prescribed in accordance with the label.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nChronic Liver Disease and Cirrhosis Mortality Rates are Disproportionately Increasing in Younger Women in the US between 2000-2020.\r\n Mortality rates due to CLD and cirrhosis in the U.S. are increasing disproportionately in younger women. This finding was driven by higher rates in Non-Hispanic White and Hispanic individuals, with variation between U.S. states. Future studies are warranted to identify the reasons for these trends with the ultimate goal of improving outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Stiffness Measurement and Risk Prediction of Hepatocellular Carcinoma After HCV Eradication in Veterans with Cirrhosis. \r\nLSM predicts rates of HCC in patients with HCV cirrhosis after SVR at multiple cutoff levels and offers a single test to predict portal hypertension-related complications and HCC. Patients with LSM <5 kPa in the absence of diabetes mellitus had a low risk of HCC where surveillance could be discontinued.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRegression of liver fibrosis in patients on hepatitis B therapy is associated with decreased liver-related events.\r\nAntiviral therapy-induced liver fibrosis regression assessed by P-I-R score is associated with reduced liver-related events. This shows the utility of histologic fibrosis regression assessed by on-treatment P-I-R score as a surrogate endpoint for clinical events in patients with HBV-related fibrosis or early cirrhosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReliability and Responsiveness of Histologic Indices for the Assessment of Crohn's Disease Activity.\r\n CD and UC indices were similarly reliable and responsive in measuring histologic CD activity.

Measurement of pharmacokinetic parameters of DOACs may be useful in identifying patients at higher risk of post-ESD bleeding.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nENDOSCOPIC SUBMUCOSAL DISSECTION WITH VERSUS WITHOUT TRACTION FOR PATHOLOGICALLY STAGED T1B ESOPHAGEAL CANCER: A MULTICENTER RETROSPECTIVE STUDY.\r\n ESD with traction seems to be associated with higher odds of negative VM than ESD without traction for pathologically staged T1b EC, and future well-conducted prospective studies are warranted to establish the findings of the current study.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopic Powered Resection Device for Residual Colonic Lesions: The First Multicenter, Prospective, International Clinical Study.\r\nEPR is a safe and effective for benign, persistent, large (>20mm) scarred, colorectal adenomas and should be considered as an alternative treatment in lieu of surgery. Persistence rate of 46.7% show that more than one treatment are necessary for effective endoscopic treatment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Impact of Transpancreatic Precut Sphincterotomy on the Quality of Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography in a Low-Volume Setting.\r\nTPS can effectively enhance the quality of ERCP irrespective of practice volume.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    10-year follow-up results of the European Achalasia Trial: a multicentre randomised controlled trial comparing pneumatic dilation with laparoscopic Heller myotomy.\r\nPD and LHM are equally effective even after 10 years of follow-up with limited risk to develop gastro-oesophageal reflux. Based on these data, we conclude that PD and LHM can both be proposed as initial treatment of achalasia.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCompared to histamine-2 receptor antagonist, proton pump inhibitor induces stronger oral-to-gut microbial transmission and gut microbiome alterations: a randomised controlled trial.\r\n Our study provides evidence that PPIs have a greater impact on the gut microbiome and oral-to-gut transmission than H2RAs, shedding light on the mechanism underlying the higher risk of certain diseases associated with prolonged PPI use.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDupilumab demonstrated efficacy and was well tolerated regardless of prior use of swallowed topical corticosteroids in adolescent and adult patients with eosinophilic oesophagitis: a subgroup analysis of the phase 3 LIBERTY EoE TREET study.\r\n Dupilumab 300 mg once a week demonstrated efficacy and was well tolerated in patients with EoE regardless of prior STC use or inadequate response, intolerance and/or contraindication to STC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIntegrative multiomics enhancer activity profiling identifies therapeutic vulnerabilities in cholangiocarcinoma of different etiologies.\r\n Our study elucidates the mechanisms underlying enhancer dysregulation and deepens understanding of different tumourigenesis processes in distinct CCA subtypes, with potential significant therapeutics and clinical benefits.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSingle-cell transcriptomic analysis deciphers heterogenous cancer stem-like cells in colorectal cancer and their organ-specific metastasis.\r\n We uncover a mechanism for organ-specific CRC metastasis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    ALDOB/KAT2A interactions epigenetically modulate TGF-ß expression and T cell functions in hepatocellular carcinogenesis.\r\nOur study has revealed a novel mechanism by which a metabolic enzyme in tumor cells epigenetically modulates TGF-ß signaling, thereby enabling cancer cells to evade immune surveillance and affect their response to immunotherapy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDeterminants of clinical response to empirical antibiotic treatment in patients with cirrhosis and bacterial and fungal infections- Results from the ICA 'Global study' [EABCIR-Global Study].\r\n Four out of 10 patients with cirrhosis do not respond to the first-line antibiotic therapy, leading to lower resolution of infections and higher mortality. Broader-spectrum antibiotics and strategies targeting systemic inflammation may improve prognosis in patients with high degree of inflammation, low serum albumin levels and severe liver impairment.  \r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHyperinsulinemia, an overlooked clue, and potential way forward in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.\r\nThe associated fasting hyperinsulinemia has been independently associated as a predictor of major adverse liver outcomes and major adverse cardiovascular events. In this review, we discuss the potential mechanism and entanglement between liver fibrosis and hyperinsulinemia and we hypothesise that the measure of fasting insulin could become a hepatic functional test within the armamentarium of non-invasive tests for the assessment of MASLD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInhibition of CAF-1 histone chaperone complex triggers cytosolic DNA and dsRNA sensing pathways and induces intrinsic immunity of hepatocellular carcinoma.\r\n Our findings suggest that CAF-1 is essential for HCC development, targeting CAF-1 may awaken the anti-cancer immune response and may work cooperatively with ICI treatment in cancer therapy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nUBXN9 inhibits the RNA exosome function to promote T cell control of liver tumorigenesis.\r\nOur results reveal a modality in which UBXN9 promotes the stimulatory RNA-induced RIG-I-IFN signaling that induces anti-tumor T cell response in liver tumorigenesis. Targeted manipulation of the UBXN9-RNA exosome circuit may have the potential to reinstate the immune control of liver tumor growth.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Comprehensive gene profiling of the metabolic landscape of humanized livers in mice.\r\n Our work revealed a complex metabolic response landscape of human liver transcriptome and provided a novel resource to understand transcriptome dynamics of human liver in response to physiologically relevant metabolic stimuli ( Impact and implications Direct knowledge of the human liver transcriptome is currently very limited hindering the overall understanding of human liver pathophysiology. We combined a liver-specific humanized mouse model and long read direct RNA sequencing technology to establish a de novo annotation of the human liver transcriptome and identified a multitude of regulated metabolic pathways that were otherwise invisible using conventional technologies. The extensive regulatory information of human genes we provided would allow basic scientists to infer the disease relevance of their genes of interest and physician scientists to better pinpoint the changes in metabolic networks underlying a specific pathophysiology.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNIS2+TM as a screening tool to optimize patient selection in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis clinical trials. \r\nWhile the use of FIB-4 alone did not lead to a significant improvement of the screening process, selecting patients using NIS2+ ™, a recently developed optimization of the NIS4® technology for the detection of at-risk MASH, showed improved performances by simultaneously reducing LBFRs and the overall cost of the trial, keeping a manageable number of patients needed to screen, without generating any bias in included patients' characteristics. This makes NIS2+ ™ an accurate and reliable screening tool for improving the recruitment of patients in future MASH clinical trials, and would lead to increased patient comfort and security, ensuring timely and cost-efficient completion of those trials.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Neurogastroenterol Motil\r\n    Esophageal Motility Abnormalities in Lung Transplant Recipients With Esophageal Acid Reflux Are Different From Matched Controls. \r\nThe strongest correlation with AET after LT was found to be esophageal peristaltic vigor. These results add to the understanding of reflux after LT and may help tailor an individualized treatment plan.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Effect of STW5 (Iberogast) on Reflux Symptoms in Patients With Concurrent Dyspeptic Symptoms: A Double-blind Randomized Placebo-controlled Crossover Trial.\r\nWe found some indications pointing towards a beneficial effect of STW5 on reflux symptoms in dyspeptic patients, with reduction of esophageal hypersensitivity as a potential underlying mechanism. Our findings will have to be confirmed in larger studies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the publisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    EXPANDING ROLE OF GASTROENTEROLOGY IN THE STAGING OF DIGESTIVE NEUROENDOCRINE TUMORS: UPDATES FROM THE AJCC VERSION 9 CANCER STAGING SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEXPLORing the therapeutic ceiling in Crohn´s Disease: will combination pave the way?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFrom Hirschowitz to 2023: Modern Endoscopy and Beyond.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe colorectal cancer enigma and early life exposures.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous\r\nmisc publications eg case reports, tools of the trade, images of the month, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Gastroenterol\r\n    A Practical Guide to the Use of Upadacitinib in Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's Disease.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCollaborative Registries for Pediatric Crohn's Disease: A Leap Forward or More of the Same?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Adenomyomatous hyperplasia of the ampulla of Vater.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLow Incidence of Pulmonary Aspiration During Upper Endoscopy in Patients Prescribed a Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 Receptor Agonist.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMesalazine-induced obstructive intra- and extra-hepatic bile duct inflammation mimicking cholangiocarcinoma.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nUnusual Villiform Re-epithelialisation in Barrett's Esophagus following Endoscopic Treatment.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopy\r\n    A tricky gastric lesion diagnosed by small-bowel capsule endoscopy.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nAspiration of tissues and ascites: the solution to endoscopic ultrasound-related duodenal perforation during pancreatic cancer sampling.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nCold snare for your polyps <10mm;

There is large uncertainty in HDV prevalence. The implementation of reflex testing would improve estimates, while also allowing earlier linkage to care for HDV-RNA-positive individuals. The logistical and economic burden of reflex testing on the health system would be limited, as it would only screen HBsAg+ cases. Impact and implications There is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the prevalence of HDV among people living with HBV at the population level. This study aimed to better understand the burden in 25 countries and territories, to refine techniques that can be used in future analyses. We found a lower prevalence in the majority of places studied than had been previously reported. These data can help inform policy makers on the need to screen people living with HBV to find those coinfected with HDV and at high risk for progression, while also highlighting the pitfalls that other researchers have often fallen into.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Neurogastroenterol Motil\r\n    The Prevalence and Characteristics of Symptomatic Uncomplicated Diverticular Disease Among Asian Patients With Unexplained Abdominal Symptoms.\r\nIt is important to recognize that patients with SUDD account for as high as 31% of outpatients with unexplained abdominal symptoms;  these patients have diarrhea and a low QOL.

Disruption of Acly nuclear translocation increases the vulnerability of steatotic liver to IR. Nuclear Acly thus may serve as a potential therapeutic target for future interventions in hepatic IR injury, particularly in the context of steatosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPrevalence and characteristics of Hepatitis delta virus infection in patients with hepatitis b in the united states: An analysis of the All-Payer Claims Database.\r\n In a large database capturing approximately 80% of the US insured population, HBV/HDV infection prevalence was 4.6% among HBV-infected adults. HDV-infected patients had high rates of baseline liver complications and other comorbidities at time of diagnosis, suggesting potentially delayed diagnosis and/or treatment. Earlier identification of HBV/HDV infection among the HBV population may provide opportunities to improve linkage to care and treatment, thereby reducing the risk of liver-related morbidity and mortality.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSingle-cell dissection of the multicellular ecosystem and molecular features underlying microvascular invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma.\r\nThis study provides a comprehensive single-cell atlas of MVI in HCC, shedding light on the complex multicellular ecosystem and molecular features associated with MVI. These findings deepen our understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving MVI and provide valuable insights for improving clinical diagnosis and developing more effective treatment strategies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Adipose tissue macrophage dysfunction is associated with a breach of vascular integrity in NASH.\r\nNAFLD-related macrophage dysfunction coincide with a loss of adipose tissue vascular integrity providing a strong plausible mechanism by which tissue inflammation is perpetuated in adipose tissue and downstream in the liver. Impact and implications Our study describe for the first time the myeloid cell landscape in human visceral adipose tissue at single cell level within a cohort of well-characterised NAFLD patients. We report unique NASH-specific transcriptional changes within metabolically active macrophages (MMacs) and resident vasculature-associated macrophages (ResVAM) and we demonstrate their spatial location surrounding the vasculature. These dysfunctional transcriptional macrophage states, coincided with the loss of adipose tissue vascular integrity, providing a strong plausible mechanism by which tissue inflammation is perpetuated in adipose tissue and downstream in the liver. Our study provide a theoretical basis for new therapeutic strategies to be directed towards reinstating ResVAM and MMac endogenous metabolic and homeostatic and cytoprotective mechanisms including their function to protect the vascular integrity and barrier.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAssociation between public health policies on alcohol and worldwide cancer, liver disease and cardiovascular disease outcomes.\r\nThe API is a valuable instrument to quantify the robustness of alcohol-related PHP establishment. Those countries with a higher API were associated with lower AUD prevalence, ALD mortality, neoplasms, alcohol-attributable HCC, and cardiovascular diseases. Our results encourage the development and strengthening of alcohol-related policies worldwide.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCharacteristics and outcomes of immunotherapy-related liver injury in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma versus other advanced solid tumours.\r\nDespite higher incidence and earlier onset in patients with HCC, IrLI is characterised by high rates of remission, low requirement for corticosteroid therapy and low risk of decompensation compared to other solid tumours. Hepatotoxicity leads to discontinuation in 7% of patients with HCC and does not negatively affect oncological outcomes. Impact and implications Immune-related liver injury (irLI) is common in patients with cancer receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), but whether irLI is more frequent or it is associated with a worse clinical course in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), compared to other tumours, is not known. Herein, we compared characteristics and outcomes of irLI in two prospective cohorts including patients treated with ICIs for HCC or for other oncological indications. irLI is significantly more common and it occurs earlier in patients with HCC, also after adjustment for duration of treatment exposure. However, outcomes of patients with HCC who developed irLI are not negatively affected in terms of requirement of corticosteroid therapy, hepatic decompensation, treatment discontinuation and overall survival.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nConvergent MAPK pathway alterations mediate acquired resistance to FGFR inhibitors in FGFR2 fusion-positive cholangiocarcinoma.\r\nThese findings suggest convergent genomic evolution in the MAPK pathway may be a potential mechanism of acquired resistance to FGFRi. Impact and implications We evaluated tumors and plasma from patients who previously received inhibitors of Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR), an important receptor that plays a role in cancer cell growth, especially in tumors with abnormalities in this gene such as FGFR fusions, where the FGFR gene is fused to another gene, leading to activation of cancer cell growth. We found that patients treated with FGFR inhibitors may develop mutations in other genes such as KRAS, and this can confer resistance to FGFR inhibitors. Clinical trial number NCT02052778.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGlobal survey of stigma among physicians and patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.\r\nPerception of NAFLD stigma varies among patients, providers, geographic locations and sub-specialties. - Despite the increasing burden of NAFLD and the fact that over 38% of the world's adult population have NAFLD, disease awareness remains low. One potential issue that may affect awareness is the stigma associated with the terms, \"non-alcoholic\" and \"fatty\". In this global study, we found that the terms patients and physicians thought to cause stigma were different. These differences may negatively affect provider-patient communication hindering prompt intervention. These results can help inform education about this liver disease especially as the new nomenclature of Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD) is being implemented. Impact and implications Over the past decades, efforts have been underway to change the nomenclature of NAFLD to better align with its underlying pathogenetic pathways and remove any potential stigma associated with the name. Given the paucity of data related to stigma in NAFLD, we undertook this global comprehensive survey to assess stigma in NAFLD among patients and providers from around the world. We found there is a disconnect between physicians and patients related to stigma and related nomenclature. With this knowledge, educational programs can be developed to better target stigma in NAFLD among al stakeholders and to provide a better opportunity for the new nomenclature to address the issues of stigma.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRedox-Sensitive High-Mobility Group Box-1 Isoforms Contribute To Liver Fibrosis Progression And Resolution In Mice.\r\nMethods & results Using electrospray ionization-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (ESI-LC-MS), we identified that disulfide ([O]) and sulfonated ([SO ] HMGB1 could point at 'resolution under way'.

EcN-HT represents a novel engineered probiotic with the potential to treat this condition. Impact and implications Patients with hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1) is characterized by an inability to metabolize tyrosine normally and suffer from liver failure, renal dysfunction, neurological impairments, and cancer. Given the overlap and complementarity between the host and microbial metabolic pathways, the gut microbiome provides a potential chance to regulate host metabolism through degradation of tyrosine and reduction of byproducts that might be toxic. Here, we demonstrated that an engineered live bacterium, EcN-HT, could enhance tyrosine breakdown, reduce the accumulation of toxic tyrosine byproducts, and protect against lethal liver injury in Fah-knockout mice. These findings suggested that engineered live biotherapeutics that can degrade tyrosine in the gut may represent a viable and secure strategy for the prevention of lethal liver injury in HT1 as well as the mitigation of its associated pathologies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCharacteristics and outcomes of immunotherapy-related liver injury in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma versus other advanced solid tumours.\r\nDespite higher incidence and earlier onset in patients with HCC, IrLI is characterised by high rates of remission, low requirement for corticosteroid therapy and low risk of decompensation compared to other solid tumours. Hepatotoxicity leads to discontinuation in 7% of patients with HCC and does not negatively affect oncological outcomes. Impact and implications Immune-related liver injury (irLI) is common in patients with cancer receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), but whether irLI is more frequent or it is associated with a worse clinical course in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), compared to other tumours, is not known. Herein, we compared characteristics and outcomes of irLI in two prospective cohorts including patients treated with ICIs for HCC or for other oncological indications. irLI is significantly more common and it occurs earlier in patients with HCC, also after adjustment for duration of treatment exposure. However, outcomes of patients with HCC who developed irLI are not negatively affected in terms of requirement of corticosteroid therapy, hepatic decompensation, treatment discontinuation and overall survival.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nConvergent MAPK pathway alterations mediate acquired resistance to FGFR inhibitors in FGFR2 fusion-positive cholangiocarcinoma.\r\nThese findings suggest convergent genomic evolution in the MAPK pathway may be a potential mechanism of acquired resistance to FGFRi. Impact and implications We evaluated tumors and plasma from patients who previously received inhibitors of Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR), an important receptor that plays a role in cancer cell growth, especially in tumors with abnormalities in this gene such as FGFR fusions, where the FGFR gene is fused to another gene, leading to activation of cancer cell growth. We found that patients treated with FGFR inhibitors may develop mutations in other genes such as KRAS, and this can confer resistance to FGFR inhibitors.
