Although we now offer a new paradigm how IL-15 trans-presentation is regulated in a B cell-dependent manner in PBC, the regulatory effects of IL-15Rα/IL-15 signaling on other chronic liver diseases remain to be further elucidated.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRestoration of N-glycosylation via leucine-activated leucyl-tRNA synthetase 1 overcomes chemoresistance in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.\r\nThis study uncovers a novel mechanism of LARS1-dependent codon-biased translation underling ICC chemoresistance. It further establishes leucine supplementation as a feasible, and potentially translational strategy to improve the efficacy of ICC chemotherapy. Impact and implications This study demonstrates that LARS1 downregulation disrupts N-glycan biosynthesis and enhances ABCC1-mediated chemoresistance in ICC. Our findings are important for oncologists and translational researchers, as they identify LARS1-dependent codon-biased translation as a critical determinant of chemotherapy response in ICC. Practically, we uncover that exogenous leucine supplementation restores LARS1 levels and synergises with gemcitabine-oxaliplatin treatment, offering a safe dietary intervention to overcome chemoresistance. These implications are firmly based on preclinical evidence, although future clinical trials are needed to validate the safety and efficacy of leucine supplementation strategies in ICC patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRivaroxaban to prevent complications of portal hypertension in cirrhosis: The CIRROXABAN study.\r\nIn cirrhotic patients with moderate liver dysfunction, rivaroxaban may improve PHT complication-free survival without significantly increasing major bleeding events. Impact and implications This study provides novel evidence of the potential use of rivaroxaban to prevent liver decompensation in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension. The observed reduction in decompensation events aligns with previous findings on anticoagulation in cirrhosis, suggesting a potential therapeutic role for rivaroxaban in this population. Although the reduction of the primary endpoint did not reach statistical significance in the whole cohort, this potential effect was observed in a post hoc analysis in Child-Pugh B patients;  however, these findings should be interpreted with caution due to the exploratory and post hoc nature of the subgroup analyses. Non portal hypertension related bleeding was overall increased in patients receiving rivaroxaban but not those that were classified as severe. These findings underscore the need for further investigation into optimal dosing strategies to maximize efficacy while minimizing bleeding risks.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Editorial on 'Prevalence and Predictors of Symptoms of Anxiety or Depression at Diagnosis in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: An Inception Cohort'.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Polypharmacy in MASLD-An Overlooked Epidemic Disproportionately Affecting Women and Patients With Cirrhosis.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Addressing Gaps in Colorectal Cancer Screening: The Role of Patient Navigation and Future Directions.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAdvancing Inflammatory Bowel Disease-driven Colorectal Cancer Management: Molecular Insights and Endoscopic Breakthroughs Towards Precision Medicine.\r\nThe future of IBD-related CRC management will incorporate a holistic, multi-integrated approach, combining AI-driven diagnostics, omics data integration, endoscopic and surgical innovations and nanotechnology-based therapies.

Subcutaneous infliximab may offer clinical benefit above the intravenous formulation. This should provide patients and clinicians with confidence in using subcutaneous infliximab in IBD. Further head-to-head trials are needed to confirm the relative efficacy between these formulations.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAm J Gastroenterol\r\n    Spectrum of Interstitial Cell of Cajal Deficits in Chronic Gastroduodenal Disorders: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.\r\n Marked depletion of ICC is a consistent finding in neurogastroduodenal disorders. A spectrum of disease is revealed, with greater depletion associated with delayed emptying. Techniques for clinically defining ICC-driven gastric neuromuscular dysfunction should be prioritized.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Clinical Trial: Association Between Early Disease Clearance and Long-Term Outcomes-4-Year Results From the Phase 3 UNIFI Study of Ustekinumab in Ulcerative Colitis.\r\nPatients who achieved disease clearance 8 weeks after ustekinumab induction were more likely to be in long-term clinical, symptomatic and quality of life remission with ustekinumab maintenance treatment than patients who did not.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDiagnostics of Autoimmune Hepatitis Enabled by Non-Invasive Clinical Proteomics.\r\nClinical proteomic analyses of paired liver-plasma samples from patients with AIH enabled high diagnostic potential. Proteomics may constitute a novel non-invasive diagnostic tool for AIH if validated in larger, age- and sex-matched cohorts.

A lower number of breakpoint types at baseline may be related to a higher HBsAg loss rate following Peg-IFN-based treatment and serve as a useful marker in guiding treatment decision-making (NCT02327416).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSystemic Biologics Have Similar Safety to Vedolizumab in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients Following Liver Transplantation.\r\n Incidence of infectious events observed between IBD/LTx patients exposed to 'gut-specific' and 'systemic' biologics were similar. Biologic choice should not be influenced by concerns regarding their co-prescription with transplant immunosuppression. Corticosteroid co-therapy at biologic initiation may be associated with more severe infectious events.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Magnitude of Polypharmacy and Role of Disease Severity and Patient Sex in Medication Use Among Patients With MASLD Enrolled in TARGET-NASH.\r\nPolypharmacy is common among patients with MASLD. Those with cirrhosis are most affected, and women with cirrhosis are at an even greater risk. Opioid, benzodiazepine, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use is prevalent among patients with cirrhosis despite the known associated risks. Frequent medication use for chronic pain in patients with cirrhosis highlights the need for management plans that optimise safety balanced against therapeutic efficacy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAm J Gastroenterol\r\n    Defining risk in Alcohol associated Liver Disease using the Model for End Stage Liver Disease.\r\nThese data illustrate the natural history of ALD and define the risks of outcomes based on the MELD score across the spectrum of disease.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLocal post-procedural cryoprevention significantly reduces the incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis: a multicenter randomized controlled trial.\r\nCryoprevention using ice water significantly reduced PEP incidence, demonstrating a safe, effective, and low-cost strategy.

VIVID-1 was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03926130.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nComparative Effectiveness of Empiric Treatment for Helicobacter pylori in a Large, Diverse Population in the United States.\r\nIn a large, community-based U.S. population, concomitant and bismuth-quadruple therapies had the highest eradication rates for H. pylori for initial treatment without a substantial decline in efficacy over time, while bismuth quadruple was the most successful salvage regimen. History of macrolides or metronidazole use should be reviewed to inform treatment selection. Repeat use of previously prescribed regimens should be avoided.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImpact of serious infection on mortality of patients with chronic liver disease: a nationwide population-based cohort study.\r\nPatients with CLD exhibited a trend of increased mortality dependent on the number of serious infections and the degree of disease severity of CLD ranging from CLD without cirrhosis, compensated cirrhosis, and decompensated cirrhosis. Decompensated cirrhosis has more than three-fold risk of infection than CLD without cirrhosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInterventional radiological management for Budd-Chiari syndrome: a 10-year retrospective, multicenter survey on 997 patients in China.\r\nWith predominantly IVC-obstruction presented and recanalization used, interventional radiological treatment could achieve a good long-term outcome in Chinese patients with BCS.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRisk for Metachronous Advanced Neoplasia in Patients with a Modified Definition of Advanced Adenoma: Data from the New Hampshire Colonoscopy Registry.\r\nThe modified AA groups had a statistically higher risk of a modified AN outcome and a numerically higher CRC risk than the 10-19mm TA group. Future studies should validate these findings and extend them by examining differences in metachronous risk within the 10-19mm TA group.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndosc Int Open\r\n    Internal traction in endoscopic full-thickness resection for gastric subepithelial lesions arising from the muscularis propria: Comparative study.\r\nInternal traction using the novel clip-with-spring device could significantly improve safety and efficacy of gastric EFTR in the distal stomach.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopy\r\n    Encapsulation levels rather than elapsed time after the onset of acute pancreatitis are related to clinical outcomes of pancreatic walled-off necrosis.\r\nIn patients undergoing EUS-guided WON treatment, the encapsulation status, rather than the time elapsed since disease onset, appeared to be associated with clinical outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    Endoscopic ultrasonography-guided biliary drainage via the afferent limb using forward-viewing echoendoscope for managing choledochojejunal anastomotic stricture.\r\n FVEUS-BD via the afferent limb is an effective and safe rescue method for managing severe choledochojejunal anastomotic strictures. In benign strictures, it offers the potential for achieving a stent-free status and could become a standard approach.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    <i>Helicobacter pylori<\/i> antibiotic resistance: a global challenge in search of solutions.\r\nBackground antibiotic resistance requires an urgent revision of current management strategies. Possible solutions include AST-based selection of effective treatment regimens, identification of novel combinations of existing drugs and exploration of novel drugs.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTherapeutic inhibition of HBsAg and HBV cccDNA through a novel phased combination treatment: glycine and interferon-α.\r\n Glycine has the potential to reduce HBV cccDNA levels by stimulating hepatocyte proliferation. The phased administration of glycine and IFN-α significantly enhances its therapeutic efficacy. These findings suggest a novel and promising strategy for the treatment of CHB.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    Pretreatment serum bile acid composition and predictability of subsequent response to odevixibat in patients with bile salt export pump (BSEP) deficiency.\r\nHigher pretreatment serum levels of unconjugated CA and CDCA are associated with subsequent response to odevixibat in patients with BSEP deficiency. Response to odevixibat may be related to residual biliary bile acid secretion capacity in patients with BSEP deficiency.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Effect of rifaximin in patients with severe cirrhosis and ascites: A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial.\r\nRFX had no beneficial effect in terms of 12-month survival or incidence of complications of liver cirrhosis in patients with severe cirrhosis and low ascitic fluid protein levels. Improving patient adherence could reduce liver complications of cirrhosis. Impact and implications Selective gut decontamination using norfloxacin is the standard of care for secondary prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Evidence for primary prophylaxis of SBP is weaker, and fluoroquinolones have been associated with an increased risk of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Rifaximin, a well-tolerated broad-spectrum antibiotic with a lower risk of AMR emergence, may be an alternative to norfloxacin. Our trial did not demonstrate an improvement in survival or liver complications (SBP, gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy or hepatorenal syndrome) at 12 months with rifaximin as primary prophylaxis for SBP versus placebo. However, in the subgroup of patients who adhered to rifaximin, liver complications decreased. Our study highlights the importance of study drug adherence in clinical trials to adequately assess outcomes. Clinical trial number NCT03069131.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEnhanced surveillance, subtyping, and host adaptation analysis reveal genotype-wide zoonotic potential of rat hepatitis E virus.\r\nRHEV shows genotype-wide potential for human spillover infection across its phylogeny. Global surveillance and sequencing efforts of rHEV in humans and rodents are required. Impact and implications Rat hepatitis E virus (rHEV) is an emerging cause of viral hepatitis in humans, but a comprehensive zoonotic assessment is hampered by a lack of sequences and systematic subtyping methods. Using a new, extended dataset of human-derived rHEV strains, we found a wide phylogenetic distribution of human-derived rHEV globally. Regardless of derived host, rHEV codon adaptation was similar for humans, indicating that al rHEV strains should be assumed to have zoonotic potential. Selection analyses revealed that human-derived sequences may be more tolerant to the accumulation of mutations at ORF2, which encodes the viral capsid. Some human-derived strains even showed lower codon usage bias, suggesting that they may have higher survivability and replication across multiple hosts. These results are relevant to clinicians and policymakers as they prove the importance of instituting rHEV surveillance in humans and rodents.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMevalonate pathway promotes liver cancer by suppressing ferroptosis through CoQ10 production and selenocysteine-tRNA modification.\r\nWe unraveled the intriguing relationship between the mevalonate pathway, CoQ10 production, and selenoprotein translation. The anti-tumor roles of 6-FMEV and atorvastatin highlight the potential of targeting the pathway as a promising therapeutic strategy for HCC. Impact and implications Current treatments show limited efficacy in advanced HCC. This study provides evidence that targeting the mevalonate pathway promotes ferroptosis in HCC by impairing CoQ10 synthesis and selenoprotein translation. Clinically, repurposing atorvastatin or MVD inhibitor 6-FMEV inhibits tumor growth across various HCC subtypes in animal models. Moreover, combining the mevalonate pathway inhibitors with TKIs or ICIs enhances the anti-tumor role, highlighting the translational potential of our study.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMolecular signatures discriminating different types of rejection in human liver transplants.\r\nWe report transcriptome features of cAMR that is a unique molecular identity associated with inflammation and fibrogenesis as described in other solid organ transplantations and being linked to a high rate of liver graft failure.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Editorial to \"Effect of Nucleos(t)ide Analogues Withdrawal on Survival Outcomes in Patients With Hepatitis B Virus-Related Acute-On-Chronic Liver Failure\".\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: ABID-LSM-A Promising Model for Predicting Decompensation Risk in MASLD Cirrhosis.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Are Antidepressant Medications Safe in Inflammatory Bowel Disease?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: H. pylori Treatment-Old Ingredients in New Effective Regimens.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    A note from the Editor-In-Chief.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopic ultrasound-guided gastrojejunostomy for management of malignant gastric outlet obstruction: here to stay, but not everywhere.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFuture of pancreas divisum diagnosis: linear-array endoscopic ultrasound leads the way.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nProximal and distal, but why not middle esophagus?

CIDEB inhibition represents a promising approach, and somatic mutations in CIDEB might predict the patient populations that might benefit the most. Impact and implications It is not clear why somatic and germline CIDEB mutations are protective in MASLD. Cideb mutations are predominantly loss of function, and Cideb-deficient clones selectively expand in specific dietary contexts such as CDA-HFD-induced MASLD. Consistently, liver-wide deletion of Cideb ameliorates MASLD most profoundly after CDA-HFD feeding. Mechanistically, Cideb deficiency enhances hepatic fatty acid β-oxidation via ATGL and PPARα activation. These findings suggest that CIDEB inhibition might be most effective in patients with the subtypes of MASLD that promote the expansion of CIDEB mutant clones.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSpatiotemporal liver dynamics shape hepatocellular heterogeneity and impact in vivo gene engineering.\r\n These insights into spatiotemporal hepatocyte dynamics enhance our understanding of liver biology and have important implications for therapeutic strategies. Impact and implications We provide new insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of the mouse liver during postnatal growth, highlighting both proliferative and transcriptomic heterogeneity among hepatocytes and their impact on the efficiency and distribution of in vivo lentiviral gene delivery and targeted gene editing. Understanding and manipulating the biological processes behind this heterogeneity can enhance gene transfer outcomes. We report that not al hepatocytes contribute equally to liver growth, indicating that effectively targeting clonogenic hepatocytes in the newborn liver is crucial for the long-term maintenance of therapeutic genetic modifications. Furthermore, this phenomenon can be leveraged to expand the pool of genetically corrected cells, as illustrated here by a targeted gene editing strategy. Finally, we reveal the existence of a tissue niche that supports the proliferation of both clonogenic hepatocytes and hematopoietic progenitors in neonatal livers. Gaining a deeper understanding of this niche and its signals could be beneficial for regenerative purposes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Neurogastroenterol Motil\r\n    Assessing Treatment Outcomes in Achalasia Using 4-Dimensional High-resolution Impedance Manometry.\r\nIBP and clearance ratio help to identify abnormal barium retention in patients after treatment. 4D manometry can be an alternative or complementary approach to characterize and assess treatment response of Achalasia, in additional to TBE or functional lumen imaging probe.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAssessment of Small Bowel Motility Using Cine-magnetic Resonance Imaging in Patients Suspected With Chronic Intestinal Pseudo-obstruction.\r\nCine-MRI is useful in assessing SB motility that cannot be detected on CT.

Cross-protective antibodies targeting antigenic site 1 can be used to inform the development of practical strategies for preventing rHEV infection.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPhase 1 randomized double-blind study of an RNA interference therapeutic targeting HSD17B13 for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis.\r\nRapirosiran exhibited an encouraging safety and tolerability profile, with robust reduction in liver HSD17B13 mRNA expression. Impact and implications Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a prevalent chronic liver disease with a high burden of disease. The hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 13 gene (HSD17B13) is implicated in the pathogenesis of MASH. Rapirosiran offers a novel mechanism to treat MASH by directly reducing hepatic HSD17B13 expression. In this Phase 1 study, rapirosiran demonstrated an encouraging safety and tolerability profile and resulted in robust reduction in liver HSD17B13 mRNA expression following two subcutaneous doses. The data support further development of rapirosiran as a potential treatment option for patients with MASH, a disease for which there is only one approved pharmacological treatment.
