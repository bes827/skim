However, TXI may be effective in detecting flat polyps.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    Diagnostic efficacy of an extracellular vesicle-derived lncRNA-based liquid biopsy signature for the early detection of early-onset gastric cancer. \r\nThe low levels of this biomarker in postsurgery and other gastrointestinal tumour plasma samples indicated its GC specificity. The newly developed EV-lncRNA signature effectively identified EOGC patients at a resectable stage with enhanced precision, thereby improving the prognosis of patients who would have otherwise missed the curative treatment window.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRectal diclofenac versus indomethacin for prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis (DIPPP): a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial. \r\nClinicalTrials. gov (NCT05947461).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    Deep learning analysis of magnetic resonance imaging accurately detects early-stage perihilar cholangiocarcinoma in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. \r\nThe 3D DenseNet-121 MRI model effectively detects early-stage pCCA in PSC patients. Compared to expert radiologists, the model missed fewer cases of cancer.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHLA-DQB1*03:01 and risk of Hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma.\r\nHLA-DQB1*03 01 and its three key amino acids are associated with an increased HBV-related HCC risk. This association may be explained by the low binding affinity to HBV antigen, resulting in poor control of viral load and increased inflammation, as evidenced by sPD-1 levels.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHigher level of Hepatitis B Surface antigen associated with delayed development of hepatocellular carcinoma in immune-tolerant patients. \r\nPredictive roles of HBV DNA and HBsAg levels in HCC development differ between HBeAg-negative and HBeAg-positive patients. Particularly, among immune-tolerant patients, HBsAg levels ≥10,000 IU/mL showed delayed development of HCC, suggesting HBsAg as a biomarker to define genuine immune-tolerant patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPopulation perspectives on benefits and harms of screening for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. \r\n  This population-based survey demonstrates that the perceived benefits of proactive MASLD screening, such as increased awareness, lifestyle changes, and early diagnosis, outweigh the harms. These findings highlight the importance of early screening through patient-centered protocols to improve health outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPre-B-Cell leukemia transcription factor 1 contributes to liver fibrosis by enabling IL-7 signaling in hepatic stellate cells.\r\nOur data uncover a previously unappreciated role for PBX1 in HSC activation and provide proof-of-concept for targeting IL-7 signaling in the intervention of liver fibrosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Norway rat hepacivirus resembles hepatitis C virus in terms of intra-host evolution and escape from neutralizing antibodies.\r\nThis study demonstrates the correlation between nAbs and viral evolution during long-term NrHV infection. The observed humoral immunity for NrHV infection closely resembles that of chronic HCV infection, where late-emerging high-level nAbs fail to clear evolving viral populations, thereby contributing to the evasion of the adaptive immune response. Preexisting antibodies do, however, protect from infection.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSimultaneous liver transplant and sleeve gastrectomy provides durable weight loss, improves metabolic syndrome and reduces allograft steatosis.\r\nLTSG results in sustained weight loss, resolution of diabetes and hypertension, and reduced recurrence of steatosis and possibly fibrosis compared to LT alone. It confers no increase in mortality or graft loss.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Editorial: Can We Prevent Inflammatory Bowel Disease? \r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Coeliac Disease and Women's Reproductive Health: A Lifelong Challenge. \r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Linking Overt Hepatic Encephalopathy Post-TIPS to Mortality! \r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Prevalence of Suspected Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease in Adolescents in the United States Using Updated Diagnostic Criteria. \r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    A comprehensive review of geriatric syndromes and assessment in older adults with inflammatory bowel diseases.\r\nGeriatric syndromes are prevalent and negatively impact older patients with IBD.

This study aimed to compare the diagnostic accuracy of the dry suction versus wet suction technique in solid pancreatic lesions (SPLs) and determine the optimal number of passes for EUS-FNB. Methods This investigation was conducted as a multicenter, randomized, controlled, non-inferiority trial. Patients with SPLs were randomly allocated to receive either the dry or wet suction technique. The primary outcome was diagnostic accuracy. The secondary outcomes included sensitivity, specificity, optimal number of needle passes, specimen quality, procedure time, and adverse events. Results Of the 200 patients, 193 were included in the final analysis, with 96 in the dry suction group and 97 in the wet suction group. The diagnostic accuracies were 97.92% and 96.91% in the dry and wet groups, respectively, with a 1.01% difference between the study groups (two-sided 95% CI, -3.47% to 5.48%, P=0.659). The overall adverse event rate was 2.6%. No significant differences were observed in sample adequacy (98.9% vs 98.9%, P = 1) or blood contamination (P = 0.796). Regarding procedure time, there was no statistical difference (18.68±8.03 min vs 19.36±8.89 min, P=0.626);  however, more procedural steps were required in the wet suction technique. No significant difference was found between the cumulative diagnostic accuracy of each needle (1st pass 93.78% vs 2nd pass 95.34% vs 3rd pass 97.41%, P = 0.225). Disscussion The dry suction technique is non-inferior to the wet suction technique for EUS-FNB in SPLs. In the absence of rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE), only one pass was required to achieve more than 90% diagnostic accuracy.

The results provide evidence that ratHEV should be monitored and included in the differential diagnosis of acute hepatitis. Clinical trial number ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier  NCT05062967 IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS  While rat hepatitis E virus (ratHEV) is a newly emerging zoonotic virus worldwide, the results of the present study indicate that the molecular diagnosis methods for this virus may be inappropriate. After establishing a proper molecular diagnostic algorithm using available assays, we demonstrated that ratHEV is an emerging and underdiagnosed aetiological agent of acute hepatitis of unknown origin. The results also expand the knowledge of the diversity of ratHEV strains capable of infecting humans in Europe. These findings strongly suggest that ratHEV should be monitored and included in the differential diagnosis of acute hepatitis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nValue of non-invasive test dynamics in guiding HCC surveillance decisions after HCV cure in patients with cirrhosis.\r\nThe dynamics of NITs following SVR do not identify cirrhotic patients who could be safely excluded from surveillance programmes. NIT current value is more informative than slope which would necessitate to regularly re-assess HCC risk to design individualized surveillance strategies. Impact and implications It has been postulated that that monitoring noninvasive tests (NIT) dynamics following HCV cure may inform on HCC residual risk in patients with cirrhosis, and may allow for the discontinuation of surveillance in certain patient subsets. We analyzed data from over 3,000 patients and found that while al NITs improved in cirrhotic patients who did not develop HCC, those who eventually developed liver cancer showed more contrasted changes in these tests. Specifically, the current values of tests like Fib4 and APRI were linked to an increased risk of HCC. while their slopes did not provide additional useful information, suggesting that dedicated prospective studies are warranted to define how repeated measurement of NIT could be combined with other variables into HCC risk stratification algorithms. Until then, HCC surveillance should be maintained in al patients with cirrhosis following HCV eradication, even in case of decreased NIT.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Editorial: Balancing the Yin and Yang of Alcohol-Associated Liver Disease-Integrating Pathophysiology, Liver-Directed Therapy and Addiction Management.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Beyond Clinical Trials-Real-World Data Suggest Usefulness of GLP-1 RAs in MASLD Treatment.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Can We Modify the Development and Disease Course of Inflammatory Bowel Disease by Diet?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Risk of Incident Type 2 Diabetes and Prediabetes in Patients With Direct Acting Antiviral-Induced Cure of Hepatitis C Virus Infection.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Blue Notes.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Randomized Trial on Dietary Elimination Based on IBS-Specific IgG Testing: Has the Evidence for Food Sensitivity Arrived? \r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    A note from the Editor-in-Chief. \r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAddressing the obesity epidemic through safe and effective endoscopic bariatric therapies. \r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAdvancing the management of achalasia with peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) versus pneumatic balloon dilation: Is POEM the superior choice? \r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nERCP in the era of single-use endcaps and single-use duodenoscopes. \r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFiducial markers in esophageal and rectal cancer therapy: potential benefits and financial considerations. \r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImpact of difficult biliary cannulation on post-ERCP pancreatitis: Who is high risk, and is it time for a paradigm shift? \r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    Vasomics of the liver. \r\nDespite this, vasomics is yet to be widely recognised.
