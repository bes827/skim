IPMN surveillance strategy should be tailored based on these features and modulated over time.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    A genome-wide association study identified PTPN2 as a population-specific susceptibility gene locus for primary biliary cholangitis.\r\nPTPN2, a novel susceptibility gene for PBC in the Japanese population, may be involved in the pathogenesis of PBC via an insufficient negative feedback loop caused by the PTPN2 risk allele of rs2292758 in IFN signaling. This suggests that PTPN2 could be a potential molecular target for PBC treatment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAlcohol-associated liver disease - global epidemiology.\r\nAddressing the growing ALD concern requires robust public health initiatives, heightened awareness, refined diagnostic techniques, and comprehensive epidemiological studies. These measures are vital to tackle the increasing prevalence of ALD and mitigate its extensive impact on individuals and healthcare systems.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJFH1-based Core-NS2 genotype variants of HCV with genetic stability in vivo and in vitro: Important tools in evaluation of virus neutralization.\r\nThese mouse-selected HCV recombinants enable triage of new vaccine-relevant antibodies in vitro and further allow characterization of protection from infection in vivo using identical viruses in human-liver chimeric mice. As such, these viruses will serve as important resources in testing novel antibodies and can thus guide strategies to develop an efficient protective vaccine against HCV infection.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPNPLA3 rs738409, age, diabetes, sex, and advanced fibrosis jointly contribute to the risk of major adverse liver outcomes in metabolic-associated steatotic liver disease.\r\nThe deleterious effects of PNPLA3 rs738409 on the risk of MALO are significantly worsened by advanced fibrosis, age, T2DM, and sex.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nVascular damage and excessive proliferation compromise liver function after extended hepatectomy in mice.\r\nIn summary, SFSS arises from an imbalance and desynchronized interplay between functional regeneration and vascular restructuring. To improve survival following SFSS-hepatectomy, it is essential to adopt a two-pronged strategy aimed at preserving the function of proliferating parenchymal cells and simultaneously attenuating vascular damage.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Comparison of non-contrast abbreviated MRI and ultrasound as surveillance modalities for HCC.\r\nAnnual NC-AMRI showed a marginally higher sensitivity than biannual US for HCC detection in high-risk patients. The DY of annual NC-AMRI was significantly higher than that of biannual US, without increasing the FRR. Alternating US and NC-AMRI at 6-month intervals could be an optimal surveillance strategy for high-risk patients. Impact and implications Current guidelines permit the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a surveillance tool for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients in whom ultrasonography (US) is inadequate. However, the specific indications, imaging sequences, and surveillance intervals for MRI surveillance remain unclear. In our study, we found that annual non-contrast (NC)-abbreviated MRI (AMRI) exhibited marginally higher sensitivity and significantly better diagnostic yield than biannual US in high-risk patients for HCC. Adopting alternating US and NC-AMRI at 6-month intervals demonstrated significantly improved sensitivity compared to biannual US, making it a potentially optimal surveillance strategy for high-risk patients.

The DY of annual NC-AMRI was significantly higher than that of biannual US, without increasing the FRR. Alternating US and NC-AMRI at 6-month intervals could be an optimal surveillance strategy for high-risk patients. Impact and implications Current guidelines permit the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a surveillance tool for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients in whom ultrasonography (US) is inadequate. However, the specific indications, imaging sequences, and surveillance intervals for MRI surveillance remain unclear. In our study, we found that annual non-contrast (NC)-abbreviated MRI (AMRI) exhibited marginally higher sensitivity and significantly better diagnostic yield than biannual US in high-risk patients for HCC. Adopting alternating US and NC-AMRI at 6-month intervals demonstrated significantly improved sensitivity compared to biannual US, making it a potentially optimal surveillance strategy for high-risk patients.

Impact and implications We have shown the role of EMC10 in the regulation of energy homeostasis and obesity. In this study, we determine the distinct roles of the two isoforms of EMC10 in the regulation of hepatic ER stress and steatosis in mice, and associations of MASLD with different EMC10 isoforms in humans. Our findings delineate a novel regulatory axis for hepatosteatosis and identify EMC10 as a modulator of the PERK-eIF2α-ATF4 signaling cascade that may be of broad physiological significance. Moreover, our pre-clinical and clinical studies clearly provide the foundations for translation of scEMC10 modulation for the treatment of MASLD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGenetic risk accentuates dietary effects on hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis in a population-based cohort.\r\nEffects of diet on LFC and cT1 were markedly accentuated in patients at increased genetic risk for SLD, implying dietary interventions may be more impactful in these populations.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJNJ-73763989 and bersacapavir treatment in nucleos(t)ide analog suppressed patients with chronic hepatitis B: REEF-2.\r\nFinite 48-week treatment with JNJ-3989+JNJ-6379+NA resulted in fewer and less severe posttreatment HBV DNA increases and ALT flares, and a higher proportion of patients with off-treatment HBV DNA suppression, with or without HBsAg suppression, but did not result in FC.

The survival data of second-line cabozantinib following the first-line ICI regimen provide reference for clinical trial testing post-ICI therapy. The number of prior line of treatment may be considered a stratification factor in randomized study. Impact and implications There is a lack of prospective data on systemic therapy following prior immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The current phase II clinical trial reported the efficacy and safety data of cabozantinib in patients with prior ICI-based treatment. Exploratory analyses showed that the performance of cabozantinib differed significantly when used as second or third-line treatment. The above data could be used a reference for clinical practice and design of future clinical trials on subsequent treatment following ICIs.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nProminent role of gut dysbiosis in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis-related liver disease in mice.\r\n Defective CFTR in the gut sustains a pathogenic microbiota, creates an inflammatory milieu, and alters intestinal permeability. These changes are necessary for the development of cholangiopathy. Restoring CFTR in the intestine or modulating the microbiota could be a promising strategy to prevent or attenuate liver disease. Impact and implications Severe cystic fibrosis-related liver disease (CFLD) affects 10% of the patients and contributes to increased morbidity and mortality of CF patients. Treatment options remain limited due to a lack of understanding of the disease pathophysiology. The Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) mediates Cl - and HCO - secretion in the biliary epithelium and its defective function is thought to cause cholestasis and excessive inflammatory responses in CF. However, our study in CFTR-knockout mice demonstrates that microbial dysbiosis, combined with increased intestinal permeability caused by defective CFTR in the intestinal mucosa, acts as a necessary co-factor for the development of CFLD-like liver pathology in mice. These findings uncover a major role for the gut microbiota in CFLD pathogenesis and call for further investigation and clinical validation to develop targeted therapeutic strategies acting on the gut-liver axis in CF.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nProspective head-to-head comparison of non-invasive scores for diagnosis of fibrotic MASH in patients with type 2 diabetes.\r\n Our findings show that FAST, MAST, MEFIB and FNI are accurate non-invasive tools to identify T2DM patients with fibrotic MASH in secondary/tertiary diabetes clinics. Cutoffs adapted to T2DM population should be considered.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Neurogastroenterol Motil\r\n    Effect of Trimebutine and Rifaximin on Breath Hydrogen and Methane by Glucose Breath Test in Patients With Functional Bloating: A Randomized Double-blind Clinical Trial.\r\nMethods We performed a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial ( no.
