Impact and implications The current subclassification of steatotic liver disease (SLD) relies on self-reported alcohol use, which is frequently limited by patient underreporting, potentially leading to diagnostic misclassification. In this study of 391 community-dwelling adults with overweight/obesity and SLD assessed by advanced MRI methods, we found that 15.9% (95% CI  12.2%-19.5%) of individuals with SLD underreported alcohol use based on their phosphatidylethanol (PEth) levels. Male gender, absence of type 2 diabetes, and White race were the strongest independent factors associated with alcohol underreporting in this population. The incorporation of PEth alongside self-reported alcohol use resulted in a 4-fold increase in MetALD diagnoses and a 3-fold increase in ALD diagnoses. These findings support the clinical utility of PEth as a direct, quantitative, objective alcohol biomarker which may help clinicians identify SLD subcategories and differentiate between its metabolic and alcohol-related etiologies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Editorial: Endomysial Antibodies for a No-Biopsy Diagnosis of Coeliac Disease-The Jury Is Still Out.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Patient Reported Outcomes Provide Insight Into Disease Severity for People Living With Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Shooting in the Dark-The Problem With Empiric Antispasmodics for Abdominal Pain in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReview: Human Intestinal Barrier-Optimal Measurement and Effects of Diet in the Absence of Overt Inflammation or Ulceration.\r\nCurrently, data are not exclusively from human studies, and research is needed to corroborate observations in animals or further validate in humans.

ASPH markedly enhanced ICC invasion The ASPH inhibitor CEP significantly inhibits ICC progression and may serve as a targeted therapeutic drug for ICC. Tumor cells in N1 lymph nodes demonstrate high expression of tumor-specific MHC-II molecules, but silencing of co-stimulatory factors such as CD80/CD86 induces CD4+ T cells into an anergic state. Our study indicated that ASPH and MHC-II may serve as novel therapeutic targets for ICC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Association of candidate surrogate endpoints with overall survival in advanced biliary tract cancer.\r\n PFS shows a moderate correlation with OS both at the trial- and patient-level, while ORR and DCR show a low correlation. Whilst PFS is currently the best candidate surrogate marker for OS, our results highlight the need for novel endpoints in this field. Impact and implications The use of validated surrogate endpoints in biliary tract cancer trials may decrease costs and improve study feasibility, particularly with agents that only target small subsets of patients or in trials that incorporate a cross-over design. A formal statistical validation of surrogacy requires patient-level and trial-level data. This is the first comprehensive analysis to incorporate novel agents (including immunotherapies and targeted agents), include patient-level data and rigorously and homogeneously extract appropriate measures of treatment effect for endpoint correlation. These results show a moderate correlation for progression-free survival both at the trial- and patient-level and a low correlation for disease-control rate and response rate. This information will aid clinicians in appropriately interpreting contemporary clinical trials and guide clinical researchers and trial sponsors involved in clinical trial design. Furthermore, it has important implications for the regulatory approval process and may aid agencies in appropriately evaluating novel drugs.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAttenuation of the second peak of bimodal recurrence of HBV-related HCC after curative treatment in the antiviral era.\r\n Following curative surgery or ablation, antiviral therapy against HBV is associated with reduction in late recurrence.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDissecting metabolic dysfunction- and alcohol-associated liver disease (MetALD) using proteomic and metabolomic profiles.\r\nThis study emphasizes the importance of subtyping differentiation using proteome data for personalized treatment and improved prognostic outcomes in MetALD patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSteatotic liver disease induces YAP/TAZ-driven cell competition that can suppress tumor initiation.\r\nThese findings reveal that steatotic hepatocytes in early MASLD can activate endogenous cell competition programs to suppress tumor initiation, a process that depends on Yap/Taz activity. This adds a new layer to our understanding of how fitness landscapes and cell-to-cell interactions within the tissue microenvironment shape cancer risk. It also shows that progression of chronic liver disease not only promotes tumorigenesis through effects of inflammation and fibrosis on tumor cells but also by disrupting the competitive defenses of normal surrounding cells. Impact and implications We found that early stages of steatotic liver disease (MASLD) can suppress tumor initiation in mouse models of liver cancer by triggering Yap/Taz-mediated cell competition. This reveals an unexpected tumor-suppressive role for early MASLD and highlights the importance of non-cell autonomous mechanisms during tumor initiation. Since Hippo-YAP/TAZ signaling is deregulated in many cancers, similar cell competition-based mechanisms may operate in other tissues.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Editorial: Clinical Impact of Lipid Profile Change After DAA Treatment in CHC Patients.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Time to EXIT?

MetALD and ALD were associated with progressively higher risks of liver-related mortality compared with MASLD. These findings underscore the need for integrated strategies addressing alcohol use, cardiovascular risk, and cancer screening to reduce preventable deaths. Impact and implications Causes of death across the steatotic liver disease spectrum remains incompletely characterized in routine clinical settings. In this large nationwide cohort study, we evaluated cause-specific mortality in patients with MASLD, MetALD, and ALD. We showed that cardiovascular disease and extrahepatic cancer were the primary causes of death in patients without cirrhosis across SLD subtypes, while liver disease and cardiovascular disease were predominant in those with cirrhosis. Importantly, MetALD and ALD were associated with progressively increasing risks of liver-related mortality compared to MASLD. Our findings highlight the need for integrated care models that simultaneously addresses cardiovascular risk factors, implements strategies to reduce alcohol consumption, and promotes cancer screening to mitigate preventable deaths in SLD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Editorial: Breath Profiling in MASLD-A Step Towards Better Risk Stratification.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Bias in the Bowels: Disparities Exist in Constipation Testing in a Diverse Patient Cohort.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nBlue Notes.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Presentation of the Julius M.
