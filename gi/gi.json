These findings highlight the need for targeted interventions to support gastrointestinal and mental health in this vulnerable working population.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Mental health diseases are associated with active hepatitis C and partly drive HCC trends in Veterans.\n In a large cohort of Veterans with cirrhosis, any MHD significantly increased incident HCC risk and associated with active HCV, even in the post-DAA era, with AUD and ALD having the largest effects. Multidisciplinary management of vulnerable, at-risk Veterans is needed to mitigate the risk of HCC.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Prevalence and Outcomes of Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Multinational Study across Asia.\n PSC is less prevalent among Asian IBD patients than in Western populations. The increased use of MRCP may enable earlier detection, contributing to milder disease severity and improved clinical outcomes in recent years.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx The \"A-B-C\" classification reveals outcome trajectories in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma under atezolizumab/bevacizumab.\n The Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab-Cluster (A-B-C) classification for unresectable HCC identified subgroups with histology, hepatic decompensation and patterns of progression, and prognostic trajectories, informing hypothesis generation for trial design and patient selection.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Endoscopy\n    Safety and efficacy of traction robot-assisted endoscopic submucosal dissection for early gastric cancer: a randomized pilot trial.\nDespite no significant difference in procedure time between robot-assisted and conventional ESD (58.21 vs 39.21 minutes;  0.99) resection rates between robot-assisted and conventional ESD, respectively. This preliminary evidence supports the feasibility of robot-assisted gastric ESD.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Gastrointest Endosc\n    Optimal endoscopic treatment for rectal neuroendocrine tumors, confirmed after forceps biopsy: A Korean Association for the Study of Intestinal Diseases multicenter, randomized non-inferiority trial.\nThe m-EMR did not demonstrate non-inferiority to ESD for complete resection of biopsy-proven rectal NETs ≤10 mm. Thus, when both m-EMR and ESD are accessible, m-EMR may not be the preferred resection modality in patients subjected to pre-resection forceps biopsy. Further studies are needed to explore the potential role of m-EMR in resource-limited settings. (Trial number  KCT0006881).\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Real-World Outcomes of Endoscopic Ultrasound-Guided Tissue Acquisition for Actionable Diagnosis in Suspected Primary or Recurrent Lymphoma.\nEUS-guided biopsy is safe and yields accurate results in most patients with suspected lymphoma. In clinical practice, the use of EUS-guided biopsy for suspected recurrent lymphoma with a confirmed biopsy is increasing. These findings support its expanding role as a minimally invasive alternative diagnosis method.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Superiority of Excellent Over Good Bowel Preparation for Proximal Serrated Polyp Detection in a FIT-Based Screening Cohort.\nAiming for an excellent rather than a good bowel preparation is a critical strategy to maximize the detection rate of serrated pathway lesions and potentially reduce the incidence and mortality for interval colorectal cancer (CRC). This benefit does not extend to adenoma detection, underscoring the importance of PSDR and SSLDR as distinct and complementary quality indicators.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Gut\n    Discovery of a carboxyl fullerene derivative as a new lipid droplet regulator inhibiting MASLD.\nThis study provides proof-of-concept supporting a nanoparticle-based agent as a LD homeostasis-targeted therapeutic to treat MASLD and related metabolic diseases.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Does a long time to colonoscopy after a positive faecal immunochemical test result have a deleterious impact on colorectal cancer outcomes? A nationwide cohort study.\n No increased risk of CRC, advanced-stage CRC or AA was observed up to 24 months. Our findings suggest that ensuring colonoscopy compliance after a positive FIT may take precedence over rigid adherence to interval. The higher the f-Hb, the sooner the colonoscopy should be performed.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Gut microbe alleviates stress-related cancer metastasis by oleic acid degradation.\nShotgun metagenomics and metabolomics were performed to assess changes in microbiota and metabolites. The effects of and OA may help prevent stress-related tumour progression.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Intraperitoneal translocation of gut microbiota induces NETosis and promotes endometriosis.\nDesign We combined single-cell RNA sequencing of clinical peritoneal fluid immune cells with functional validation in heterologous and homologous mice models. We further adopted microbial source-tracking analysis of patient cohorts and interventional strategies, including faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and administration of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged triggers NETosis in peritoneal Neu_MME to promote disease, suggesting that targeting this bacterium or NETosis represents a viable therapeutic strategy.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Hepatology\n    Targeting mTORC2-Dependent AKT/FOXO1/RNF125 signaling exploits a therapeutic vulnerability in c-MET-activated and β-catenin-mutated hepatocellular carcinoma.\nOur study, for the first time, established the mTORC2/AKT/FOXO1/RNF125 axis as a critical driver and therapeutic vulnerability in c-MET-activated/β-catenin-mutated HCC. Our study filled a critical gap by defining the tumor-suppressive role of FOXO1 specifically in this HCC subtype. Furthermore, our results positioned RNF125 as a promising therapeutic target for this aggressive HCC subtype.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx J Hepatol\n    A genome-wide siRNA screen identifies previously unknown proviral and antiviral host factors in HBV infection.\nThis study identifies NCOA5 and CHD4 as crucial proviral cofactors and NRAS as a potent antiviral factor regulating HBV replication. The findings highlight HBV's profound host dependence, uncover specific molecular mechanisms (involving HNF4A, epigenetic regulation of cccDNA, and cell cycle), and reveal validated host targets for potential therapeutic strategies against HBV infection.  \nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Maladaptive emergency granulopoiesis predicts poor outcomes in patients hospitalized with decompensated cirrhosis.\nUsing data obtained on admission of patients with ADC without ACLF, this study uncovered that activation of maladaptive EG characterized patients who will develop ACLF by 28 days. Impact and implications This study reveals that among patients who present for acutely decompensated cirrhosis without acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) those who exhibit blood transcriptomic features of maladaptive emergency granulopoiesis are at high risk of developing ACLF by 28 days and dying by 90 days. These results strongly suggest that neutrophil-granulopoietic perturbations play a pathogenic role in the development of poor outcomes. These results should lead to the development of biological therapies targeting neutrophil-granulopoietic perturbations, which is an unmet need. These findings should also give rise to the identification of potential biomarkers for ACLF development, which is also an unmet need, al previous studies having failed to accurately predict this outcome, in particular with the use of clinical blood counts.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Targeting ATR to overcome cisplatin resistance in hepatoblastoma.\nATR mediates cisplatin resistance in HB. The combination of elimusertib and cisplatin demonstrated preclinical efficacy across patient-derived cultures and multiple in vivo HB models, supporting its potential as a promising therapy for cisplatin-resistant HB. Impact and implications () Chemoresistance significantly reduces survival in hepatoblastoma patients, highlighting the need for new therapies. In this study, we found that blocking ATR with the drug elimusertib synergizes with cisplatin, strongly reducing tumor growth in diverse preclinical models, including cell cultures and mouse models of cisplatin-resistant HB. These results highlight a promising new approach to improve outcomes for children with cisplatin-resistant HB and support further clinical evaluation.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \n\n\nReviews&Editorials\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\npublisher website using the provided link\n\n\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\n    Editorial for 'Review Article: Extending the Frontiers of Intestinal Ultrasound Knowledge, Performance, and Expansion'.\n\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Editorial: Caught in the Middle-Exploring the Grey Zone Between Decompensated and Recompensated HBV-Related Cirrhosis.\n\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Gastroenterology\n    The Role of Alcohol in Pancreatic Diseases: A Comprehensive Perspective.\nAlthough behavioral strategies, such as abstinence, remain essential, pharmacologic and molecularly targeted therapies offer potential complementary approaches.

Reducing alcohol intake, alongside targeted management of CMRFs, may improve strategies for preventing severe liver disease.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx HBV induces liver fibrosis through the generation of reactive oxygen species in a pyruvate-dependent manner.\nHBV infection induces pyruvate production and decreases PPARα expression, leading to increased ROS generation and liver fibrosis. Pyruvate and PPARα represent novel targets for antifibrotic therapeutic development in CHB.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx J Hepatol\n    A phase IIIb study of 8-week glecaprevir/pibrentasvir treatment in adults with acute hepatitis C.\nAn 8-week glecaprevir/pibrentasvir regimen was efficacious and well-tolerated in patients with acute HCV. These results support glecaprevir/pibrentasvir use in HCV test-and-treat models, potentially streamlining the care cascade, reducing transmission, and supporting HCV elimination. Impact and implications Currently, approved hepatitis C treatments are available only for chronic HCV in most geographies, with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir recently approved in the US for acute HCV. The lack of therapeutic options delays treatment initiation, increasing the risk of disengagement among people who inject drugs and other vulnerable groups, and contributing to onward transmission. This study demonstrates that 8-week glecaprevir/pibrentasvir therapy is efficacious and safe in patients with acute HCV infection, supporting its role as a recently approved treatment for acute HCV. Availability of an approved treatment for acute HCV will support the implementation of test-and-treat strategies in outreach settings for key prevalent populations, reducing delays and improving care retention, particularly among high-risk individuals. Clinical trial number NCT04903626.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Geographic disparities in hepatitis B vaccine coverage across Africa: Implications for targeted interventions and 2030 goals.\nIncremental gains in HepB3 uptake and widening subnational inequities threaten HBV elimination across administrative levels in Africa.

Impact and implications Modification of ploidy play a substantial role in cancer genome evolution. In this study, we created a new digital pathology method to accurately measure the hepatocyte ploidy profile of HCC. This powerful tool reveals three distinct tumor types  Diploid (DP), Hyperploid (HP), and mixed Diploid/Hyperploid (DP/HP) HCCs. By clearly defining these groups, we gain crucial, new insights into the \"branching\" evolution of HCC tumors. This study should pave the way for novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx MARCO<sup>+<\/sup> macrophages drive immunosuppressive remodeling and metastasis in chemotherapy-associated steatohepatitis.\nThis study uncovers a distinct immunoregulatory network in CASH, providing potential avenues for mitigating chemotherapy side effects and developing novel immunotherapeutic strategies for patients with liver metastases.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Open-label, single-arm, phase 2 trial to investigate the efficacy of sitravatinib plus tislelizumab combination as a second-line treatment for advanced biliary tract cancer.\nSitravatinib/tislelizumab combination as second-line treatment in patients with advanced BTC demonstrated meaningful efficacy and an acceptable safety profile. Patient selection using HRD biomarkers may be a promising strategy in this setting. Impact and implications The results of this multi-center, open-label, phase 2 study suggest that immunotherapy and anti-angiogenic agent combination treatment has a promising efficacy and safety as second-line treatment for patients with advanced biliary tract cancer. Furthermore, the presence of HRD detected on tumor NGS may select patients who have benefit from this combination, which supports further research exploring immunotherapy with anti-angiogenics combination strategy in this setting.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \n\n\nReviews&Editorials\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\npublisher website using the provided link\n\n\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\n    Editorial: An Important Step Towards Mastering Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis-Targeted Therapy in Diabetes.\n\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Editorial: Efficacy of Pharmacological Compared With Dietary Therapy for Patients With Irritable Bowel Syndrome-It Is Nice to Have a Choice.\n\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Editorial: High-Grade Dysplasia in Colonic Inflammatory Bowel Disease Is Associated With a High Risk of Synchronous or Metachronous Colorectal Cancer.\n\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Editorial: Remission Ambition-How Far Should We Push in Older Adults?\n\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Editorial: Shingles Risk in IBD-More Evidence to Support Routine Preventive Vaccination?\n\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Editorial: The Appendix-A Dead End for Treating Ulcerative Colitis, After All?\n\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Review article: Seeing Is Believing-The Eosinophilic Oesophagitis Endoscopic Reference Score Can Serve as a Valuable Clinical Trial Endpoint in Eosinophilic Oesophagitis.\nPEC has a role in histologic response assessment and should not be completely discounted.
