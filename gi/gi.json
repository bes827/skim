The emergence of the preS2 deletion mutants in patients could be due to its enhanced ability to evade the host immunity.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAm J Gastroenterol\r\n    Efficacy and safety of transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation in patients with constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome: a single-center, single-blind, randomized controlled trial.\r\n The study manifested that non-invasive taVNS effectively improved constipation and abdominal pain symptoms in IBS-C patients. The alleviation of IBS-C symptoms may be attributed to the integrative effects of taVNS on rectal functions, mediated through vagal, cholinergic, and multi-omics mechanisms.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEvaluating Artificial Intelligence-Driven Responses to Acute Liver Failure Queries: A Comparative Analysis Across Accuracy, Clarity, and Relevance.\r\n The study highlights Chat GPT 4 +RAG's superior performance compared to other LLMs. By integrating RAG with LLMs, the system combines generative language skills with accurate, up-to-date information. This improves response clarity, relevance, and accuracy, making them more effective in healthcare. However, AI models must continually evolve and align with medical practices for successful healthcare integration.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nProximal polyps are associated with higher incidence of colorectal cancer: Analysis of the Minnesota Colon Cancer Control Study.\r\n Although patients with proximal adenomas were found to have higher hazards of post-colonoscopy CRC, adjusting for polyp multiplicity attenuated the strength of association. Further research is warranted to determine whether polyp location should be factored in the determination of appropriate surveillance intervals.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Role of Gastroesophageal Reflux in Airway Inflammation.\r\nBoth experimental and clinical studies have shown that aspirated refluxate can directly damage the airway lining and trigger immune responses that contribute to airway injury and inflammation. While traditional diagnostic tests for gastroesophageal reflux disease can identify abnormal reflux patterns, there is a need for more specific methods to predict airway inflammation or therapeutic outcomes related to reflux aspiration.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    A randomized phase 2 study of efmarodocokin alfa, an IL-22 agonist, versus vedolizumab in patients with ulcerative colitis.\r\n Efmarodocokin alfa did not demonstrate efficacy compared to placebo and this phase 2 study was ended early for futility;  however, there was evidence of target engagement (skin AEs, REG3A levels);  NCT03558152.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAcute Kidney Injury in Patients with Cirrhosis and Chronic Kidney Disease: Results from the HRS-HARMONY Consortium.\r\n In hospitalized patients with AKI and cirrhosis, AoCKD was associated with lower 90-day mortality compared to AKI-only. This may be due to the impact of worse liver function parameters in the AKI-only group on short-term outcomes. Further study of the complicated interplay between acute and chronic kidney disease in cirrhosis is needed.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEfficacy and Safety of Budesonide Orodispersible Tablets for Eosinophilic Esophagitis up to 3 Years: an Open-Label Extension Study.\r\nClinical and histological remission of EoE could be maintained with BOT in a large majority of patients for up to 96 weeks, and for up to 144 weeks in patients with uninterrupted BOT therapy across al trials. No additional safety concerns were identified with long-term BOT treatment. (ClinicalTrials.gov, Number  NCT02493335).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopic sleeve gastroplasty plus lifestyle intervention in patients with MASH: a multicentre, sham-controlled, randomized trial.\r\nBaseline to end of follow-up changes in body weight, liver tests, liver stiffness(VCTE) and liver histology were recorded RESULTS: Total Body weight loss(TBWL) was 9.47%(±9.38) in ESG group vs 3.91%(±5.43) in ESI group(p 10% we found a significant improvement on NAS score(-4±0.94 vs -0.81±1.62, p<0.01), but not in fibrosis stage(-0.3±1.06 vs -0.59±1.25). Only 2 patients of ESG group had adverse events that required admission that resolved conservatively in 72 hours CONCLUSION: ESG is an effective and safe method to promote weight reduction associated with significant improvement in patients with MASH and obesity.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGlobal Trend of MASH-associated Liver Cancer A Systematic Analysis from the Global Burden of Disease 2021.\r\nOver the past two decades, the burden of MASH-associated PLC has risen, though there are sociodemographic and geographic disparities. This necessitates urgent strategies across the globe to mitigate the epidemic of MASH-associated PLC as well as its metabolic drivers.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHypercoagulation after Hospital Discharge in Acute Severe Ulcerative Colitis: A Prospective Study.\r\nGlobal measures of haemostasis demonstrated that patients with ASUC were pro-thrombotic compared to controls with quiescent colitis. This difference was maintained 8 to 12 weeks after the initial presentation, supporting clinical observations that patients with ASUC have an elevated risk of VTE after hospital discharge.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInadequate Efficacy of Biologics for Treating Proximal Ileal Lesions in Crohn's Disease; a prospective multicenter study.\r\nA substantial proportion of patients with CD exhibited ulcerations in the proximal ileum which correlated with a poorer prognosis. These lesions proved challenging to heal, regardless of the type of biologic used.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLipoprotein (a) in the Full Spectrum of MASLD; Evidence from Histologically and Genetically Characterized Cohorts.\r\nThe inverse association observed in cross-sectional studies should be attributed to reverse causality i.e. the presence of liver disease may decrease Lp(a) levels. Genetically predicted very low Lp(a) levels are also associated with impaired liver health prospectively. Clinical trials evaluating Lp(a)-lowering agents should thus be monitored carefully for adverse liver effects in subjects attaining extremely low concentrations.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNeighborhood social determinants of health are associated with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease outcomes.\r\n Neighborhood-level SDOH are associated with MASLD burden, comorbidities, and mortality and should be considered in clinical care, quality improvement, and further research.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNon-alcohol-related cirrhosis leads to higher 6-week mortality after acute variceal bleeding than alcohol-related cirrhosis.\r\n Patients with non-ALD cirrhosis presenting with AVB had a higher risk of 6-week mortality, at each severity of liver disease by standard indices, than patients with ALD cirrhosis. Cirrhosis etiology (ALD versus non-ALD) should be incorporated into the risk stratification of AVB patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNon-invasive assessment of portal hypertension in patients with primary biliary cholangitis is affected by severity of cholestasis.\r\nBiochemical-based RESIST criteria demonstrate the highest net benefit compared to elastography-based criteria for ruling out HRV.

Young age at diagnosis increased the probability of progression, whereas increasing duration of mild disease decreased the probability.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSerum Albumin and Its Trajectory Are Associated with Therapeutic Outcomes in Ulcerative Colitis.\r\n Higher albumin levels were associated with better therapeutic outcomes in patients with UC. However, patients with low but rapidly ascending albumin levels would achieve outcomes comparable to those with medium-to-high levels of albumin.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTHE OPTIMAL DURATION OF pH-MONITORING: TESTING THE VALIDITY OF LYON 2.0 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR WIRELESS pH MEASUREMENT.\r\n The results of this analysis validate the recommendation that prolonged reflux studies of at least 72-hr duration provide optimal AET measurements for GERD diagnosis. Prolonging studies can also resolve inconclusive results based on 24- and 48-hr studies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nValidation and epidemiologic definition of the novel steatotic liver disease nomenclature in a national United States cohort with cirrhosis.\r\n Classification of SLD is highly sensitive to relative weighting of CMRFs and alcohol use. Clinically relevant definitions should consider data availability on alcohol and the limitations of lipid measurements in distinguishing SLD subtypes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndosc Int Open\r\n    Efficacy of anti-obesity medication (AOM) and endoscopic gastric remodeling (EGR): Analysis of combination therapy with optimal timing and agents.\r\nCombining AOM with EGR appears to result in greater weight loss compared with other strategies, with GLP-1RA as the preferred agent and optimal initiation of both therapies occurring within 6 months of each other. Prolonged medication use prior to EGR appears to be associated with suboptimal weight loss, suggesting the importance of early referral for adjunctive therapy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nSpinal anesthesia for endoscopic submucosal dissection of large rectosigmoid lesions: Feasibility study.\r\nOur initial experience suggests that SA for ESD of large rectosigmoid LSTs is feasible, and it may prove to be a valuable option, especially for elderly and frail patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nSplenic injury associated with colonoscopy in hospitalized patients: Incidence, risk factors, management, and outcome.\r\nAdministrative data analysis suggests that splenic injuries due to colonoscopy are more frequent than previously estimated. Endoscopists should be aware of this rare life-threatening adverse event.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nEndoscopy\r\n    Prophylactic Clip Closure in Preventing Delayed Bleeding After Colorectal Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection on anticoagulants: A multicenter retrospective cohort study in Japan.\r\nProphylactic complete clip closure after colorectal ESD significantly reduced the DB rate in patients receiving both DOACs and warfarin. It should be performed after ESD, particularly for right-sided lesions.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Intestinal Epithelial Serotonin as a Novel Target for Treating Disorders of Gut-Brain Interaction and Mood.\r\n These findings provide fundamental insights into how the gastrointestinal tract modulates emotional behaviors, reveal a novel gut-targeted therapeutic approach for mood modulation, and suggest a new link in humans between in utero SSRI exposure and DGBI development.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    Clinical Insights and Management Strategies for Acute Obstructive Suppurative Pancreatic Ductitis: A Retrospective Study of 82 Rare Cases.\r\nAOSPD primarily affects middle-aged and elderly males with chronic pancreatic disease and prior pancreaticobiliary intervention. Imaging and pancreatic juice culture aid diagnosis. Compared to acute-on-CP, AOSPD with CP displays distinct clinical characteristics. Timely and accurate diagnosis and treatment can lead to favorable short-term outcomes for patients with AOSPD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImprovement in Obesity-Related Comorbidities 5 Years After Endoscopic Sleeve Gastroplasty: A Prospective Cohort Study.\r\nESG is an effective, noninvasive monotherapy that improved markers of hypertension, diabetes, MASLD, and led to total body weight loss of 11.8% at five years post-procedure.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nManagement of ERCP-related perforation: a large multicenter study.\r\nDiagnosing a perforation during the ERCP procedure can prevent serious complications. Fluoroscopic and endoscopic images should be carefully reviewed. Endoscopic management should be the treatment of choice for patients diagnosed with perforation during ERCP procedures.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    Early detection of colorectal cancer using aberrant circulating cell-free mitochondrial DNA fragmentomics.\r\n In conclusion, based on aberrant ccf-mtDNA fragmentomic features, a novel and non-invasive approach was established for the detection of patients with early-stage CRC or AA, with high performance.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEarly tumour necrosis factor antagonist treatment prevents perianal fistula development in children with Crohn's disease: post hoc analysis of the RISK study.\r\n Early anti-TNF therapy prevents perianal fistula development, especially among patients at increased risk.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatic TM6SF2 activates antitumour immunity to suppress metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease-related hepatocellular carcinoma and boosts immunotherapy.\r\n Hepatic TM6SF2 protects against MASLD-HCC and activates cytotoxic CD8 + T cells via NF-κB-IL-6 axis. TM6SF2 is a promising strategy for sensitising MASLD-HCC to immunotherapy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    Enhancing HBV-specific T cell responses through a combination of epigenetic modulation and immune checkpoint inhibition.\r\nThe combination of DAC/αPD-L1 shows promise in improving HBV-specific T cell responses in vitro, highlighting the potential of remodeling exhaustion-associated epigenetic signatures to enhance HBV-specific T cell restoration and suggesting a novel immunotherapeutic avenue for CHB.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInterleukin 8-CXCR2 mediated neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation in biliary atresia associated with NET-Induced stellate cell activation.\r\nBA patients have persistent IL-8-CXCR2-mediated NETosis that correlates with biomarkers of injury and fibrosis and NETs induce stellate cell activation, suggesting a role for NETs in the immunopathogenesis of disease. Future investigations should focus on therapeutic agents that inhibit NETs in BA.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInternational trends in biliary tract cancer-related mortality, 2000-2022: An observational study of the World Health Organization mortality database.\r\nAlthough internationally estimated BTC-associated ASRs showed a stable trend over the last two decades, a large increase in estimated iCCA-associated ASRs necessitates developing effective screening for high-risk individuals and disease management strategies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLhx2 specifically expressed in hepatic stellate cells promotes liver regeneration and inhibits liver fibrosis.\r\nWe demonstrated that Lhx2 had pro-regenerative and anti-fibrogenic functions, and elucidated its regulatory mechanism. The study provided a potential target with dual effects for treating liver diseases.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPlasma FSTL-1 as a noninvasive diagnostic biomarker for patients with advanced liver fibrosis.\r\nPlasma FSTL-1 has high diagnostic accuracy and could potentially reduce the need for liver biopsy in identifying patients with advanced liver fibrosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nValidation and expansion of Baveno VII criteria for cACLD and CSPH based on liver stiffness and platelet count: Correlation with risk of hepatic decompensation and death.\r\nThe Baveno VII \"Rule-of-Five\" criteria provide a valid system for stratifying risks of death and hepatic decompensation and should be used routinely in patients with chronic liver disease. Among patients with CSPH (LS ≥25 kPa), the subgroup with LS 50-75 kPa (\"critical\" CSPH) has approximately double the risk of death and hepatic decompensation than LS 25-49.9 kPa.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nValue of HCC surveillance in a landscape of emerging surveillance options: Perspectives of a multi-stakeholder modified delphi panel.\r\nThe panel acknowledged performance metrics of emerging methods may differ from other cancer screening programs given differences in populations, including higher risk of cancer development and competing risk of morality, and differences in diagnostic workflow in patients at risk of HCC. These data provide insights into the perceived value of HCC surveillance in an era of emerging blood- and imaging-based surveillance strategies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    A new generation of non-invasive tests of liver fibrosis with improved accuracy in MASLD.\r\nFIB-12, outperformed al other NITs. FIB-9 is suitable for screening and FIB-11 or FIB-12 for diagnosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nA read-through circular RNA RCRIN inhibits metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.\r\nOur findings provide an in vivo function of rt-circRNA RCRIN, show its inhibitory effects in MASLD pathogenesis, indicating RCRIN and RPL8 may be therapeutic targets and candidate nucleic acid drugs for treating MASLD. Impact and implications Our finds reveal a novel mechanism connecting a read-through circRNA RCRIN, ribosome heterogeneity and MASLD pathogenesis. In normal hepatocytes, RCRIN exerts its role by reducing liver lipid accumulation and ER stress through promotion of RPL8 degradation. In MASLD patients, lower RCRIN releases RPL8 to form RPL8-contained ribosomes to promote lipid accumulation and ER stress. RCRIN overexpression and RPL8 depletion dramatically suppresses MASLD development and progression. Our findings indicate that RCRIN and RPL8 might be potential therapeutic targets for treatment of MASLD patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAll-cause and cause-specific mortality in patients with chronic hepatitis B and concurrent steatotic liver disease.\r\nAmong patients with CHB and SLD, metabolic burden dose-dependently increases the all-cause, liver-related, and cardiovascular mortality risks. Patients with SLD have a lower mortality risk than those without SLD. Identifying these metabolic dysfunctions is crucial for stratifying the level of risk in daily care. Impact and implications Concurrent steatotic liver disease (SLD) is prevalent among patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB);  however, the effects of the associated cardiometabolic risk factors on all-cause and cause-specific mortality remain unknown. This study demonstrated that cumulative metabolic burden dose-dependently increased the risks of all-cause, liver-related, and cardiovascular mortality in patients with CHB and SLD. Moreover, new-onset diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and weight gain during the follow-up period further exacerbated these risks. However, patients with SLD had a lower risk of mortality than those without SLD. Thus, routine screening and monitoring of metabolic dysfunctions constitute a key element of daily care for patients with CHB.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCarvedilol vs. propranolol for the prevention of decompensation and mortality in patients with compensated and decompensated cirrhosis.\r\nOur data endorse the current recommendation favoring the use of carvedilol in the prevention of a first decompensation of cirrhosis and suggest extending the recommendation for its preferential use to patients with decompensated cirrhosis without recurrent or refractory ascites. Impact and implications This study addresses a gap in the comparative effectiveness of classical non-selective beta-blockers (e.g., propranolol and nadolol) versus carvedilol in managing cirrhosis in both compensated and decompensated stages. Our results support the preferential use of carvedilol in both settings due to its superior efficacy in reducing first and further decompensation. However, the retrospective nature of the study and inherent selection biases advise caution against broadly applying these findings to patients with decompensated cirrhosis who exhibit signs of circulatory dysfunction or recurrent/refractory ascites.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImpact of metabolism-disrupting chemicals and folic acid supplementation on liver injury and steatosis in mother-child pairs.\r\nPregnancy MDC exposures may increase risk for liver injury and steatosis, particularly in children. Adequate FA supplementation and maternal cobalt levels may attenuate these associations. Impact and implications The effects of environmental chemical exposures on steatotic liver diseases are not well understood. In a parallel investigation of mothers and children, we found that pregnancy exposures to metabolism-disrupting chemicals may increase the risk for liver injury and steatosis, especially in the child, and that these associations could be attenuated by higher folic acid and/or cobalt levels. These findings can inform policies to decrease environmental chemical pollution and contribute to the design of clinical interventions addressing the MASLD epidemic.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImpaired whole blood thrombin generation is associated with procedure-related bleeding in acutely decompensated cirrhosis.\r\nIn compensated cirrhosis, WB-TG and PPP-TG do not improve risk stratification. In decompensated cirrhosis, WB-TG may be a promising tool for estimating procedure-related bleeding risk.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Neurogastroenterol Motil\r\n    Incidence and clinical course of post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome in patients admitted to university hospitals: 1-year prospective follow-up study.\r\nThe incidence of PI-IBS in Korea was relatively low, and most cases improved over time. No risk factors associated with the development of PI-IBS were found. However, persistent diarrhea after enteritis was associated with female sex, EPEC infection, and severe or long-lasting enteritis. IBS symptoms may persist after severe enteritis but usually improve with time.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRandomized Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Fexuprazan According to the Timing of Dosing in Patients with Erosive Esophagitis.\r\nNon-inferiority analysis revealed that taking fexuprazan after meal was non-inferior to taking fexuprazan before meals in patients with EE.

Here, from an analysis of the WHO guideline development process and its new recommendations, we aimed to identify the anticipated areas of agreements and controversies with the next liver society hepatitis B guidelines which will have to balance clinical risks and benefits for the patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeta-analysis\r\nmeta-analyses and systematic reviews\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Mortality of Acute Kidney Injury in Cirrhosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Over 5 Million Patients Across Different Clinical Settings.\r\nAKI substantially affects the prognosis of patients with cirrhosis, especially those in ICU and/or with ACLF.

Results We first unveiled significant gut microbiota dysbiosis in NKTCL patients, prominently marked by a notable reduction in to ameliorate this malignancy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopic papillectomy versus surgical ampullectomy for adenomas and early cancers of the papilla: a retrospective Pancreas2000/European Pancreatic Club analysis.\r\nThe rate of patients with poor indications due to non-neoplastic disease or advanced cancer is still high for both EP and TSA;  multiple retreatments were necessary for EP. Although EP can be considered an appropriate primary therapy for certain ampullary adenomas, case selection for both therapies (especially with regard to the best step-up approach) should be studied further.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    Distinct immune microenvironment of venous tumor thrombus in hepatocellular carcinoma at single-cell resolution.\r\nTAMs, especially C5aR+ TAMs, were enriched in PVTT.

GalNAc siCnnm4 therapy boost the repair processes of ethanol damaged proteins through the upregulation of PCMT1 activity.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOutcome and management of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who achieved a complete response to immunotherapy-based systemic therapy.\r\nOverall survival and recurrence-free survival of patients with CR-mRECIST-only and CR-RECISTv1.1 were excellent, and 6 of 7 patients with CR-mRECIST-only who underwent surgical conversion therapy had pathological CR. Despite potential limitations, these findings support the use of mRECIST in the context of immunotherapy for clinical decision-making.

The prospective anti-HDV screening provides a blueprint for using existing hepatitis B virus screening programms for population-based HDV double reflex testing, provided that adequate logistical prerequisites are established.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAm J Gastroenterol\r\n    ACG Clinical Guideline: Treatment of Helicobacter pylori Infection.\r\nThe CPG concludes with a discussion of proposed research priorities to address knowledge gaps and inform future management recommendations in patients with H. pylori infection from North America.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Metabolic Dysfunction and Alcohol-related Liver Disease (MetALD): Position statement by an expert panel on alcohol-related liver disease.\r\nAdditionally, metabolic dysfunction and alcohol use should be reassessed over time, especially after periods of changes in risk factor exposure. This approach could ensure a more accurate prognosis and effective management of SLD addressing both metabolic and alcohol-related factors.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeta-analysis\r\nmeta-analyses and systematic reviews\r\n\r\n\r\n    Gastroenterology\r\n    Fecal hemoglobin levels in prior negative screening and detection of colorectal neoplasia: a dose-response meta-analysis.\r\n Our findings suggest that the risk of detecting colorectal neoplasia increases with prior f-Hb concentrations in negative tests, supporting the development of risk-stratified screening strategies based on these concentrations.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Black Race is Associated with Decreased Exposure to Advanced Therapies and Worse Outcomes in Individuals with Ulcerative Colitis.\r\n Black individuals with UC are prescribed fewer disease-specific therapies compared to White individuals and have increased hospitalizations and mortality. Black individuals have higher rates of opioid prescriptions. Opioids have been associated with increased complication rates in inflammatory bowel disease. These trends are not seen in Asian individuals. This reveals critical disparities in the care of Black people with UC with opportunity for targeted interventions.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClinical Trial: Treatment of Functional Dyspepsia According to Subtype Compared With Empirical Proton Pump Inhibitor.\r\n Initial treatment of FD according to subtype was not more effective than empirical PPI alone for up to 8 weeks. Further multicentre studies, with a larger sample size, are recommended to validate these findings.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCoronary Artery Disease and Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events in People With Hepatic Steatosis at Low Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk.\r\nIndividuals with HS at ASCVD < 7.5% risk had similar CAD characteristics as patients without HS at < 7.5% ASCVD risk, yet experienced comparable MACE rates as those at ASCVD ≥ 7.5%.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEarly HBcrAg and Anti-HBc Levels Identify Patients at High Risk for Severe Flares After Nucleos(t)ide Analogue Cessation-A Pooled Analysis of Two Clinical Trials.\r\n Higher HBcrAg, lower anti-HBc and higher HBcrAg/anti-HBc ratio at EOT and during the first weeks of post-treatment follow-up are associated with an increased risk of hepatic flares after NA withdrawal and could therefore potentially be used to select patients eligible for therapy cessation and to identify patients requiring retreatment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNo Association Between Eosinophilic Oesophagitis and Oesophageal Cancer in US Adults: A Case-Control Study.\r\nEoE is not associated with the development of oesophageal cancer in privately insured adults under 65 years old;  co-incidence of EoE and oesophageal cancer is extremely rare. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings and to evaluate whether they hold in older adults or over longer follow-up, and whether EoE might protect against oesophageal cancer.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAm J Gastroenterol\r\n    Effect of Esophageal Dilation History on Efficacy Outcomes in Patients With Eosinophilic Esophagitis Receiving Budesonide Oral Suspension.\r\n Esophageal dilation history may confound the association between histologic outcomes and dysphagia symptom or endoscopic efficacy outcomes in patients with EoE receiving swallowed corticosteroids.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndosc Int Open\r\n    Areas of improvement for colorectal cancer screening: Results of a screening initiative for 10,000 health care employees in Austria.\r\nThere is a serious gap between recommended standards and real-world CRC screening colonoscopy quality. Implementation of CRC screening should not only be accompanied by strategies to increase participation rates but focus on implementation of rigorous, mandatory colonoscopy quality assurance programs.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nDigital peroral pancreatoscopy to determine surgery for patients who have intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas with mural nodules.\r\nPOPS-DS could be used to accurately detect malignancy in patients with MN-positive IPMN. Therefore, histocytological evaluation using POPS-DS can contribute to selection of patients for whom surgery would be appropriate.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nDye-based chromoendoscopy versus i-scan virtual chromoendoscopy in long-standing ulcerative colitis: Multicenter prospective RCT.\r\nHowever, use of i-scan VCE was associated with a lower false-positive rate and a significantly shorter procedure time compared with DCE. I-scan VCE, therefore, could be a valid replacement for DCE in UC surveillance colonoscopies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nEnteroscopy-assisted ERCP in patients with surgically altered anatomy: Multicenter prospective registry (SAMISEN-B) using motorized spiral enteroscopy.\r\n(clinicaltrials. gov: NCT05129449).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nEvaluating endoscopic ultrasound-guided tissue acquisition for diagnosis of small pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms.\r\nEUS-TA showed adequate diagnostic sensitivity and grading agreement for p-NENs of al sizes, allowing for determination of appropriate treatment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nFeasibility and benefit of decompressive percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (dPEG) in advanced cancer patients with malignant bowel obstruction.\r\nHowever, the technical success rate is limited and needs to be improved. Prospective studies comparing endoscopic and computed tomography-guided procedures are needed to avoid unsuccessful procedures in patients with advanced cancer and limited life expectancy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nFeasibility of newly designed rotatable sphincterotome for endoscopic sphincterotomy (with video).\r\nWe evaluated the feasibility of the newly designed r-sphincterotome using an experimental model. We believe that the findings from these experiments may contribute to easier and more precise sphincterotomies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nIntraoperative bleeding model for swine gastric endoscopic submucosal dissection via heparinization.\r\nHigh doses of heparin significantly increased intraoperative bleeding and hematoma during swine ESD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nLow incidence of deep vein thrombosis after double-balloon endoscopy and colorectal submucosal dissection: Multicenter, prospective study.\r\nThis prospective study demonstrated that risk of DVT/PE following highly invasive endoscopic procedures including colorectal ESD and DBE is very low.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nWhich is the better polyp detection metric: adenomas per colonoscopy or adenoma detection rate? A simulation modeling study.\r\nAdjusting for patient and exam factors and/or using shrinkage techniques for lower-volume endoscopists can increase the correlation between TEA for both ADR and APC. For higher detection rates, APC offers more power than ADR in distinguishing differences in detection ability.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nEndoscopy\r\n    Hemospray as first-line treatment option for malignant gastrointestinal bleeding: A cost-utility analysis in the United Kingdom.\r\nInitial treatment of MUGIB with TC-325 compared to SET is more effective (higher primary haemostasis and lower 30-day rebleeding) and cost-saving due to requiring fewer interventions, readmissions, and length of stay. Additional studies are needed to address model uncertainties in the follow-up management of these complex patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    ERBB2 comprehensive profiling and prognostication in Stage III Colon Cancer: Findings from PETACC8 and IDEA-France cohorts.\r\nThe molecular definition of ERBB2-status could represent a cost-effective alternative in stage III CC. ERBB2 alterations and low RNA expression significantly reduce TTR, highlighting the complex role of ERBB2.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMulti-HCC: A practical model to prioritize patients with hepatocellular carcinoma on the liver transplant waiting list.\r\n An urgency-based priority system for patients with HCC, similar to MELD for patients with chronic liver disease, is achievable with a parsimonious model incorporating AFP, MELD 3.0, and tumor size. This approach can be applied to the liver allocation system to prioritize patients with HCC and can inform decision-making regarding urgency weights for exception cases in the upcoming continuous distribution system.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPreclinical protein signatures of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis: A nested case-control study within large population-based cohorts.\r\n We identified protein signatures for predicting a future diagnosis of CD and UC, validated across independent cohorts. In the context of CD, the signature offers potential for early prediction.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    A randomized controlled trial of a through the scope stiffening wire to increase the depth of insertion during double balloon enteroscopy.\r\n The stiffening wire increased insertion depth and should be used when an abnormality cannot be reached with conventional technique.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCreating a Standardized Tool for the Evaluation and Comparison of Artificial Intelligence-Based Computer-Aided Detection Programs in Colonoscopy: a Modified Delphi Approach.\r\nThis is the first reported international consensus statement of priority scoring metrics for CADe in colonoscopy. These scoring criteria should inform CADe software development and refinement. Future research should validate these metrics on a benchmark video data set to develop a validated scoring instrument.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nStratification of risk for lymph node metastasis and long-term oncologic outcomes in patients initially treated by endoscopic resection for rectal neuroendocrine tumors.\r\nThe risk of LN metastasis increased significantly when the number of risk factors increased in patients with rectal NETs. Patients who initially underwent endoscopic resection for rectal NETs showed a favorable long-term oncologic outcome if salvage treatments were performed, depending on the stratification of their risk factors.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    Genetic variation at 11q23.1 confers colorectal cancer risk by dysregulation of colonic tuft cell transcriptional activator <i>POU2AF2<\/i>.\r\nBackground Common genetic variation at 11q23.1 is associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) risk, exerting local expression quantitative trait locus (cis-eQTL) effects on is the primary transcriptional activator of tuft cells with a tumour suppressive role in mouse models. We therefore implicate tuft cells as having a key tumour-protective role in the large bowel epithelium.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    Hepatic real-world outcomes with obeticholic acid in primary biliary cholangitis (HEROES): A trial emulation study design.\r\nWe identified a 63% reduced risk of hospitalization for hepatic decompensation, liver transplant, or death in OCA-treated versus non-OCA-treated individuals.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMultimodal multiphasic pre-operative image-based deep-learning predicts hepatocellular carcinoma outcomes after curative surgery.\r\n Recurr-NET accurately predicted HCC recurrence, out-performing MVI and clinical prediction scores respectively, highlighting its potential in pre-operative prognostication.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTumor-derived CCL2 drives tumor growth and immunosuppression in IDH1-mutant cholangiocarcinoma.\r\nIDH1-mutant CCA is characterized by increased abundance of M2-like TAMs. Targeting CCL2 remodels the tumor immune microenvironment and improves outcomes in preclinical models of IDH1-mutant CCA, highlighting the role for myeloid-targeted immunotherapies in the treatment of this cancer.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nmiRNAs in HCC, pathogenesis, and targets.\r\nWe also discuss the therapeutic and diagnostic potential of miRNAs and delivery approaches of miRNA drugs to overcome the limitations of current HCC treatment options. By thoroughly summarizing the roles of miRNAs in HCC, our goal is to advance the development of effective therapeutic drugs with minimal adverse effects and to establish precise tools for early diagnosis of HCC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Utility of AI digital pathology as an aid for pathologists scoring fibrosis in MASH.\r\nThe use of AI DP enhances inter-rater reliability of fibrosis staging for MASH. This indicates that the SHG/TPEF-based AI DP tool is useful for assisting pathologists in assessing fibrosis, thereby enhancing clinical trial efficiency and reliability of fibrosis readouts in response to treatments.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Neurogastroenterol Motil\r\n    Clinical Characteristics of Patients With Proton Pump Inhibitor-refractory Globus.\r\nReduced proximal BI values compared to distal BI values suggest increased permeability in globus patients.

Although inherent heterogeneity across studies limited the evidence to support expanding treatment to al patients in the indeterminate phase, antiviral therapy may reduce the risk of HCC development in high-risk subgroups. Impact and implications Current international guidelines recommend close monitoring and evaluation of patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) in the indeterminate phase, and not al of these patients are indicated for antiviral treatment. Based on the systematic review and meta-analysis with significant heterogeneity across studies, patients in the indeterminate phase are at risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cirrhosis, and hepatic decompensation. Meta-regression findings on platelet count, positive HBeAg, and age highlighted the importance of liver fibrosis assessment, accurate phase classification, and timely detection of phase transition to identify antiviral treatment indications, supporting current guideline recommendations. Antiviral treatment may reduce risk of HCC in the high-risk subgroups of patients in the indeterminate phase.
