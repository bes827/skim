Key implementation statements included in this document stress the importance of a high-quality endoscopy examination, sampling using a structured biopsy protocol, and confirming the diagnosis of BE-related neoplasia by an expert pathologist. This document also provides guidance on surveillance intervals and management of patients with BE-related low-grade dysplasia and indefinite for dysplasia. Providers should engage in shared decision making based on patient preferences. Limitations and gaps in the evidence are highlighted to guide future research opportunities. Guideline endorsement This guideline is endorsed by the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx AGA Clinical Practice Update on Endoscopic Resection for Early Colorectal Cancer: Commentary.\r\nThe target audience for this commentary includes primary care, gastroenterology, pathology, and surgical health care professionals. Methods This expert commentary was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC) and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership and underwent internal peer review by the CPUC and external peer review through standard procedures of Gastroenterology.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx AGA Clinical Practice Update on the Management of Ascites, Volume Overload, and Hyponatremia in Cirrhosis: Expert Review.\r\nCautious escalation can be done every 2-3 days with monitoring of volume status, kidney function, daily weights, and symptoms. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 13: Advanced strategies in refractory anasarca should be coordinated with nephrology for consideration of diuretics in the setting of contraction alkalosis (eg, addition of acetazolamide), second agent with alternate mechanism of actions (eg, thiazide diuretics, such as metolazone), or need for ultrafiltration.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Gastrointest Endosc\r\n    Consensus and consequences: Does the Baveno consensus deliver improved outcomes and survival?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\nMeta-analysis\r\nmeta-analyses and systematic reviews\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Meta-Analysis: Immune-Related Adverse Events Are Associated With Improved Effectiveness of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.\r\n irAEs, particularly dermatologic, endocrine and low-grade events, were associated with improved ICIs' effectiveness in HCC. Early irAEs detection and corticosteroid management preserve survival benefits. However, more large-scale prospective studies are needed to verify our findings.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Am J Gastroenterol\r\n    Excessive Intrapancreatic Fat Deposition and Risk of Pancreatic Diseases: Longitudinal Cohort Evidence from a Systematic Review with Population-Attributable Fraction Analysis.\r\n Longitudinal evidence generally supports the hypothesized role of excessive IPFD as a key contributor to the risk of major pancreatic diseases. The potential benefits of reducing IPFD appear to be greatest for acute pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Reevaluating the Role of Proton Pump Inhibitors After Endoscopic Band Ligation of Esophageal Varices in Cirrhotic Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.\r\n Current evidence is insufficient to support routine PPI use after EBL. RCT data remains underpowered and inconclusive, emphasizing the need for adequately powered trials.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Gastrointest Endosc\r\n    2025 best of systematic reviews and meta-analyses in gastrointestinal endoscopy.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Clinical Trial: Simplified Bowel Preparation for Small Bowel Capsule Endoscopy in Crohn's Disease.\r\nA simplified preparation consisting of a clear liquid diet and water is a viable alternative to a PEG-based preparation prior to SBCE in patients with CD, offering comparable SB cleanliness and diagnostic outcomes while improving acceptability.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Effects of Resmetirom on Metabolic-Dysfunction Associated Steatohepatitis in Patients With Weight Loss and/or Diabetes Taking Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists and Other Diabetes Therapies: A Secondary Analysis of the MAESTRO-NASH Trial.\r\nThe efficacy of resmetirom on multiple MASH endpoints was not impacted by background SGLT2i or GLP-1 RA treatment. Weight loss (≥ 5%) enhanced the efficacy of resmetirom.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx High Risk of Colorectal Cancer After High-Grade Dysplasia in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients.\r\nThe risk of synchronous and metachronous CRC after a diagnosis of high-grade dysplasia underlines the high-risk profile of this subgroup of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The possible advantages of colon-sparing treatment should be balanced with the higher risk of metachronous CRC and the subsequent need for stringent endoscopic surveillance.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Maternal and Perinatal Outcomes in Pregnant Women With Comorbid Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Chronic Liver Disease.\r\nCoexisting IBD and CLD confer compounded maternal and perinatal risks beyond either condition alone. Multidisciplinary care and risk-based screening for underlying CLD in pregnant women are warranted.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Persistence of Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Longitudinal Follow-Up Study.\r\n Poor psychological health persists for a substantial number of patients with IBD. Further work is needed to establish the long-term effect of mood trajectories on disease outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Research Communication: Changing Aetiology of Chronic Liver Diseases in East Asia Pacific and HCC Surveillance in Non-Cirrhotic Patients.\r\nHCC surveillance in non-cirrhotic patients was cost-effective only for chronic hepatitis B in selected older age groups, with substantial variability across countries. These findings support refining surveillance guidelines and adaptation of risk stratification tools.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Research Communication: Teriflunomide Does Not Affect Gluten-Specific T-Cell Activity in Coeliac Disease-A Randomised, Placebo-Controlled Trial.\r\nThe main aim was to observe attenuation of gluten-specific T-cell activation markers after gluten exposure. We found no significant differences in T-cell activity between groups, concluding that teriflunomide is ineffective as a non-dietary treatment for coeliac disease.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Treatment-Free Outcomes Following Surgery for IBD: A Nationwide Cohort Study.\r\nSurgery obviated the need for future therapy in 22% of patients with CD and 42% with UC. Absence of extraintestinal manifestations, older age in UC, and longer disease duration and absence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in CD may highlight an opportunity for precision surgery to identify those most likely to achieve long-term benefit from surgical intervention.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Am J Gastroenterol\r\n    Comparative Safety of Advanced Therapies in Patients with Ulcerative Colitis: An Administrative Claims-based Study.\r\nIn a real-world cohort of patients with UC, anti-interleukins and JAK inhibitors were associated with lower risk of serious infections and may offer net benefit, especially in patients with prior TNF antagonist exposure.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Demodicosis Mimics Acneiform Eruptions in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease Receiving Upadacitinib: A Case Series.\r\nDemodicosis should be considered in patients with IBD having acneiform eruptions, particularly those receiving upadacitinib.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Effects of Screening Colonoscopy: Evidence From Observational and Interventional Studies.\r\nWe conclude that, despite apparent differences in reported results, both observational and interventional provide compelling evidence for strong preventive effects of screening colonoscopy. On the population level, similarly strong incidence and mortality reduction might be reached by well-organized screening programs achieving higher adherence rates with less invasive screening tests.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Impact of Artificial Intelligence Use on Endoscopist Optical Diagnosis of Sessile Serrated Lesions, Traditional Serrated Adenomas and Advanced Conventional Adenomas.\r\nCADx use did neither significantly harm nor improve optical diagnostic performance for SSLs despite CADx inability to classify SSLs.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Per-oral endoscopic myotomy-induced reduction of crural diaphragm contractility might contribute to development of post-procedural reflux esophagitis.\r\nPOEM can impair CD contraction, and weak CD contraction was associated with post-POEM RE.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx The Risk of Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\n While the risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy overall was not increased in pregnancies affected by IBD, there was an increased risk of preeclampsia. This may reflect underlying immune-mediated placental dysfunction.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx The impact of E-Cigarettes and Heat-Not-Burn Tobacco on Postoperative Recurrence of Crohn's Disease: A Multicenter International Study.\r\n HNBT, and possibly e-cigarettes, are associated with increased endoscopic recurrence of CD compared to non-smoking.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Utility of quantitative fecal immunochemical test values for average risk colorectal cancer screening risk stratification among patients with a positive test.\r\n Neoplastic findings occurred across the whole spectrum of qFIT values, emphasising the need for colonoscopy for al positive qFIT tests. However, increasing qFIT values correlated with the PPV for CRC and advanced adenoma and may help to stratify patients at highest risk for detecting serious neoplastic lesions in resource-constrained settings.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Recent Trends of Incidence, Mortality, Treatment, and Overall Survival of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in the United States.\r\n HCC incidence rates have started to decline, and incidence-based mortality has plateaued. Given lower early-stage detection and curative treatments during the COVID-19 pandemic, longer-term follow-up is warranted to assess the impact on survival. The reduced survival disparities between non-Hispanic Black and White patients may reflect improved equitable medical access.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Seroprevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection among asymptomatic patients served by a safety-net healthcare system.\r\n In this population-based study, almost two-thirds of asymptomatic patients were seropositive for H. pylori. Prevalence was over 40% among al sub-groups. Screening solely based on race and ethnicity may inadvertently exacerbate disparities by overlooking confounding factors for infection like low socioeconomic status and regional exposures.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Endoscopy\r\n    Individuals with polyps ≥10mm without other high-risk features have a similarly low post-colonoscopy colorectal cancer risk as those with no polyps.\r\nPCCRC-risk 5 years after baseline colonoscopy within individuals with polyps ≥10mm without other high-risk features is not significantly different from individuals without polyps at baseline. Lengthening surveillance intervals would affect 79% of high-risk individuals with ≥10mm polyps as their sole high-risk feature, and 46% if limited to those with 10-20mm polyps.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Intraductal Cryobiopsy via Percutaneous Cholangioscopy for Biliary Strictures: a Multicenter Feasibility Study.\r\nThis feasibility study showed that intraductal cryobiopsy via percutaneous cholangioscopy yielded larger samples and may enable more detailed histologic assessment than forceps biopsies. Further studies will evaluate its accuracy, safety, and potential for use with peroral cholangioscopy during ERCP.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Gastroenterology\r\n    Comparative Efficacy of Advanced Therapies for Management of Moderate-to-Severe Crohn's Disease: 2025 AGA Evidence Synthesis.\r\nUsing Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation to appraise quality of evidence, this updated network meta-analysis can inform positioning of advanced therapies for the treatment of biologic-naïve and biologic-exposed patients with moderate-to-severe CD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Intestinal LKB1 Loss Drives a Premalignant Program Along the Serrated Cancer Pathway.\r\nHeterozygous loss of LKB1 pushes intestinal cells into a chronic regenerative state, which is amplified on loss of heterozygosity. Lkb1 deficiency thereby generates fertile ground for serrated colorectal cancer formation in the intestine, potentially explaining the increased cancer risk observed in PJS.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Retraction Notice to: \"CSF1 Restores Innate Immunity After Liver Injury in Mice and Serum Levels Indicate Outcomes of Patients With Acute Liver Failure\" Gastroenterology 2015;149:1896-1909.e14.\r\nThe authors requested that this paper be retracted in 2019, and the Editors of Gastroenterology agree that this manuscript should be retracted. Dr Daniel Antoine played no part in any other aspects of this manuscript, and the authors have confidence in al other data.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Gastrointest Endosc\r\n    Best practices for Endoscopic Ultrasound-guided Gastroenterostomy: technical recommendations from an International modified Delphi process.\r\nDespite technical differences (such as the preference of a jejunal catheter or a double-balloon catheter) most EUS-GE experts agree on key technical principles, providing valuable guidance on the standardization of EUS-GE in clinical practice. Conversely, certain topics show limited agreement, identifying future research priorities in the field of EUS-GE.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Extended Surveillance After Piecemeal Endoscopic Mucosal Resection: A Safe Approach to Initial Surveillance in Low-Risk Patients.\r\n A risk-stratified approach may safely extend surveillance to 12 months for lower-risk patients following piecemeal EMR, reducing unnecessary procedures without compromising care.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Peroral cholangioscopy-guided laser-stricturoplasty for intrahepatic benign biliary strictures (with video).\r\n This pilot study suggests that POCS-LAS is a technically feasible and potentially effective treatment for intrahepatic BBS.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Gut\r\n    PDE5A<sup>+<\/sup> cancer-associated fibroblasts enhance immune suppression in gastric cancer.\r\nOur study elucidates the intricate role of PDE5A + CAFs in shaping the immunosuppressive TME in GC, providing mechanistic insights and therapeutic potential for combating this aggressive malignancy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx SMYD2-mediated methylation of STAT1 protects against hepatic ischaemia/reperfusion injury by blocking JAK-STAT1 signalling pathways.\r\n This study establishes SMYD2 as a novel negative regulator of STAT1 activity through K175 methylation, providing new insights into the epigenetic control of STAT1 during hepatic I/R injury. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognised mechanism for fine-tuning STAT1 signalling in hepatic I/R injury, and targeting the SMYD2-STAT1 axis may present a promising therapeutic strategy for mitigating I/R-associated liver damage.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx iPSC-induced multilineage liver organoids, small intestinal organoids and brain organoids sustain pangenotype hepatitis E virus propagation.\r\n This study established iPSC-induced multilineage organoid infection models, confirming HEV's capacity for pan-tissue infection and revealing potential pathogenic mechanisms in the liver, intestine and nervous system. This platform provides valuable tools for HEV virology research and antiviral drug development, underscoring the unique value of organoid technology in infectious disease research.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Hepatology\r\n    Glutamine synthetase loss in β-catenin-mutant hepatocellular carcinoma promotes tumor burden through macrophage metabolic reprogramming.\r\nWe demonstrate unique metabolic dependency of β-catenin-mutated HCCs on GS in tumor cells which is diverted to macrophages upon GS elimination in tumor cells. This adaptation alters macrophage metabolism and function leading to compromised immunosurveillance and greater tumor burden. Our study reveals a metabolic dynamic between HCC cells and macrophages with impact on tumor biology.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Hepatectomy alters adjuvant anti-PD-1 action in a mouse model of HCC but does not compromise neoadjuvant efficacy.\r\nPartial hepatectomy disrupts antitumor immunity and limits adjuvant ICI efficacy. Neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 immunotherapy offers a superior strategy compared to adjuvant immunotherapy in enhancing immune responses and reducing HCC recurrence.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx MSR1+ macrophages passivate antitumor immunity by inducing ITM2A+ CD4T exhaustion differentiation.\r\nMSR1+macrophages promote tumor-infiltrating ITM2A+CD4T exhaustion differentiation by regulating the ITM2A-ZAP70 axis. ZEA-αCD4 specifically targeted MSR1-ITM2A interaction to activate antitumor immunity and improve the efficacy of αPDL1 immunotherapy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Reclassifying pediatric NAFLD using the steatotic liver disease framework: a multicenter retrospective study from the NASH CRN.\r\nMost children with NAFLD met MASLD criteria, but nearly 1 in 6 were reclassified based on alcohol use or medication exposure. These findings highlight the need for a systematic diagnostic approach accounting for metabolic risk factors, alcohol use, and medication-related liver injury.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Serum bile acid levels predict the development of portal hypertension and high-risk esophageal varices following successful Kasai in biliary atresia.\r\n In biliary atresia patients with successful KP, sBA is an early biomarker predicting the development of PH and HRV within 5 years post-KP.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx J Hepatol\r\n    HBx-induced HSPB1 is a potential therapeutic target owing to its modulation of HBV cccDNA and hepatic immune responses.\r\nHSPB1 represents a novel therapeutic target by modulating HBV cccDNA and immune responses in the liver. D-TK is a promising clinical candidate for HBV treatment through cccDNA suppression and immune activation. Impact and implications Chronic infection with HBV remains a significant global health concern, and current therapeutic options are inadequate. In this study, we demonstrate that HBx-induced elevation of HSPB1 contributes to the regulation of HBV cccDNA and the hepatic immune responses. We engineered a peptide, D-TK, that targets HBx, effectively suppresses cccDNA, and activates immune responses through HSPB1. Our findings offer new insights into the mechanism by which HBx-induced HSPB1 modulates HBV cccDNA and immune regulation in the liver.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Microbial metabolism dysfunction induced by transarterial chemoembolization aggravates postprocedural liver injury in HCC.\r\nThis is the first study to identify gut microbiota disturbance, i.e., deficiency of L. reuteri metabolite ILA, as significant cause of TACE-LI. L. reuteri and ILA administration serves as promising therapeutic approach for TACE-LI, which is crucial for reducing TACE adverse effects to achieve better prognosis in HCC. Impact and implications The majority of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are diagnosed losing the chance of surgical resection. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is widely used for treating unresectable HCC;  however, its long-term outcome is significantly limited by its main complication, i.e., liver injury (LI). In addition to traditional cognition of the direct liver damage of the ischemic necrosis or regional chemotherapy induced by TACE, the deeper mechanisms underlying TACE-induced LI (TACE-LI) remain largely unclear. Gut microbiota can modulate various liver diseases but its exact role in TACE-LI has not been reported. We found that TACE could disturb the gut microbiota. This disturbance was characterized by reduced levels of Limosilactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) and its metabolite indole-3-lactic acid (ILA), which were correlated with aggravated TACE-LI and poor overall survival in HCC. Administration of L. reuteri or ILA significantly improved TACE-LI by inhibiting the inflammation of macrophages. Our study is the first report highlighting gut microbiota disturbances as an important cause of TACE-LI;  administration of L. reuteri or ILA represents a viable and secure strategy for preventing TACE-LI, thereby reducing the adverse effects of TACE and yielding better prognoses in patients with HCC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are

S1P/S1PR4 signaling promotes cholangiocyte injury via promoting CX3CR1 + CD8 + Teff migration and their differentiation into apoptosis-inducing CD8 + TRM cells. Impact and implications Our study bridges a critical knowledge gap in biliary atresia (BA) pathogenesis by defining how sphingolipid-driven CD8 + TRM differentiation via S1P/S1PR4 signaling exacerbates bile duct injury, establishing the mechanistic link between immunometabolic dysregulation and BA progression. These findings are essential for pediatric hepatologists and immunologists, as they identify the S1 molecular subtype (characterized by poor prognosis and immune hyperactivation) as a high-risk population warranting precision intervention. For patients, S1PR4 inhibition (CYM50358) experimentally reduces biliary obstruction and improves survival in BA mouse models, supporting its prioritization for clinical trials especially in S1-subtype BA.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided

Hence, regular screening for CSPH in AIH patients seems warranted to ensure timely initiation of adequate CSPH-directed treatment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatitis B Immunoglobulins Withdrawal in Hepatitis B Virus Mono-Infected Liver Transplant Recipients: An Italian Multicentre Prospective Study.\r\nHBIG could be safely withdrawn in HBV mono-infected LT recipients on long-term combination HBIG plus third generation NAs.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nResearch Communication: Serum Metabolomic Signatures Predict Tumour Recurrence After Resection or Ablation in Patients With Early-Stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma.\r\nIn multivariable analysis, the 6-metabolite signature was associated with early recurrence (aHR 2.8, 95% CI 1.1-7.5), and the 13-metabolite signature was associated with overall recurrence (aHR 2.5, 95% CI 1.1-6.0). These data support the potential role of serum metabolites in post-treatment risk stratification for HCC recurrence.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAm J Gastroenterol\r\n    Gastrointestinal and Hepatobiliary Safety of Glucagon-like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes.\r\n In this large real-world cohort study, GLP-1 RA therapy was not associated with increased risk of most serious GI or hepatobiliary outcomes compared to other oral diabetes medications. These findings support the overall GI and hepatobiliary safety of GLP-1 RAs in patients with type 2 diabetes, while underscoring the need for vigilance regarding gastroparesis and intussusception in susceptible individuals. Longer-term studies are warranted to fully evaluate cancer risk.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nProtective association of healthy lifestyle behaviours with incident functional constipation: A population-based prospective cohort study.\r\n Adopting a higher number of healthy lifestyle behaviours is significantly associated with a reduced incidence of FC in the middle-aged and elderly population, indicating their potential to be a primary prevention strategy. Future research should explore underlying mechanisms and replicate our investigation across diverse populations.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReal-Life Clinical Validation of AI-Assisted Detection and Differentiation of Pleomorphic Lesions in Capsule Endoscopy.\r\n This was the first multicentric study proving AI-assisted CE reading superiority compared to conventional reading. The inclusion of videos from multiple devices addresses the interoperability challenge, whereas including patients from 4 countries and two different continents assures a diverse demographic context. AI achieved gastroenterologist-level identification of small-bowel lesions, surpassing conventional reading methods in both lesion detection and characterization.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRisk of venous thromboembolism following colorectal cancer surgery in patients with and without inflammatory bowel disease.\r\nPatients with IBD are at elevated risk of VTE following CRC surgery compared to those without IBD. The strongest associations were observed in those who had received IBD treatment before surgery and in those with active disease, particularly patients with UC. These findings emphasize the need for increased VTE awareness and optimizing disease control in high-risk IBD patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nScreening for Barrett's Esophagus and Esophageal Adenocarcinoma: Approaches and Outcomes.\r\nWhile direct evidence linking screening to reduced EAC mortality is lacking, trials highlight promising outcomes in early detection of precancerous and cancerous lesions. Future directions, challenges, and recommendations for optimizing BE screening are discussed.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSub-cutaneous infliximab for perianal Crohn's disease: the BioLap-Rem multicentre study from the GETAID.\r\n SC IFX was effective and safe for the treatment of active pCD and for maintaining remission after switching in this large multicentre cohort, thus supporting its use in routine practice in this indication.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Defining non-invasive criteria for indicating drug therapy in metabolic-associated steatotic liver disease in clinical practice.\r\n The diagnostic performance and reliability of the proposed non-invasive criteria for initiating resmetirom treatment were suboptimal.About the half of patients with indication would not receive treatment under these criteria.A new strategy, using FIB-4, the presence of diabetes and overweight, and liver stiffness improved the identification of MASLD patients with fibrosis stage 2-3.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGlucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists are associated with a lower risk of peptic ulcer disease: a nationwide cohort study.\r\nIn this nationwide cohort study of T2DM patients, GLP-1 RA use was associated with 44% lower odds of PUD. In our propensity-score matched sub-group, switching to GLP-1 RA as second-line therapy was associated with a 56% lower hazard of PUD vs insulin. These findings indicate an association between GLP-1 RA use and reduced risk of PUD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReliability and Responsiveness of Endoscopic Indices for Assessing Crohn's Disease Postoperative Recurrence in the PREVENT trial.\r\n Existing endoscopic indices are reliable and responsive for assessing postoperative CD activity in the neoterminal ileum, although are suboptimal for evaluation in the anastomosis or distal colonic segment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndosc Int Open\r\n    Barnacle-like lesions in the gastric mucosa: Clinicopathological study of a novel endoscopic finding.\r\nBackground and study aims Map-like redness is a known gastric mucosal finding observed after and are histopathologically consistent with intestinal metaplasia.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nCapnography monitoring reduces incidence of hypoxia in older patients undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy under propofol sedation.\r\nAdditional capnography monitoring during gastrointestinal endoscopy for older patients who were sedated with propofol reduces incidence of hypoxia.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nDiagnostic and therapeutic value of appendoscope-assisted endoscopic retrograde appendicitis therapy.\r\nAppendoscope-assisted ERAT is a feasible, accurate, safe, and effective alternative for diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nDirect visualization endoscopic retrograde appendicitis therapy versus laparoscopic appendectomy for management of acute uncomplicated appendicitis.\r\nDirect visualization ERAT demonstrated high feasibility and effectiveness as a diagnostic and therapeutic modality for acute uncomplicated appendicitis, offering a promising alternative to conventional approaches.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nEfficacy of endoscopic intermuscular dissection vs. endoscopic submucosal dissection in treating rectal neuroendocrine tumors < 10 mm.\r\nEndoscopic intermuscular dissection offers a better option for preventing positive basal margins and demonstrates good safety and feasibility.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nEfficacy of remimazolam with fentanyl vs midazolam with fentanyl for sedation in screening colonoscopy: Randomized controlled study.\r\nThis study shows clear superiority of the combination of remimazolam with fentanyl over midazolam with fentanyl for conscious sedation in screening colonoscopy, obtaining shorter procedure time, less postoperative need for observation, lower patient pain scores, and higher patient satisfaction.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nEfficacy of serial pancreatic juice aspiration cytological examination for focal pancreatic duct stenosis: Multicenter, retrospective, cohort study.\r\nSPACE was a valuable method for obtaining pathological specimens of focal pancreatic duct stenosis.

Powder reintroduction identified a large variety in individual FODMAPs and glucose as triggers.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPathological tau propagation from the brain to the colon via the vagal efferent pathway in Alzheimer's disease.\r\nThis study demonstrates that tau pathology can propagate from the brain to the colon via the vagus nerve, providing evidence supporting the brain-to-gut axis in AD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    Early on-treatment LSM reliably predicts liver-related events in CHB patients with significant fibrosis and cirrhosis.\r\nOn-treatment LSM measured 1-3 years after antiviral therapy offers superior predictive accuracy for LREs compared with baseline or LSM changes, with LSM <10 kPa indicating a significantly lower risk, likely due to improved lobular architecture.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIntegrative hepatology: Enhancing overall health to manage liver disease.\r\nImplementation faces challenges, including evidence gaps, limited training, time constraints, reimbursement barriers, and inequitable access, but opportunities exist through education, interdisciplinary collaboration, group medical visits, and digital health delivery. By expanding the scope of liver care to include whole-person health, Integrative Hepatology seeks not to replace established therapies but to augment their impact-supporting patients in achieving optimal health across the disease spectrum.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRIPPLY1 suppresses cancer cell stemness via targeting TBX19 in CTNNB1-mutated hepatocellular carcinoma.\r\n Loss of RIPPLY1 promotes cancer cell stemness via facilitating the TBX19 transcriptional activity in CTNNB1-mutated HCCs.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Alcohol activates ATF4/LPLA2-mediated BMP metabolism to enhance HBV-induced hepatocellular carcinogenesis.\r\n The data demonstrated that alcohol activates ATF4/LPLA2-mediated BMP metabolism to enhance HBV-induced HCC (HBV-HCC). LPLA2 is a potential therapeutic target and a probable marker of poor prognosis for HCC patients. Impact and implications Chronic alcohol consumption promotes HBV-induced hepatocellular carcinogenesis (HBV-HCC). ATF4/LPLA2-mediated BMP metabolism promotes alcohol-enhanced HBV-HCC via MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. Targeting LPLA2 or BMP metabolism markedly inhibited HBV-HCC progression. This preclinical study provides a theoretical basis to investigate novel strategies for HCC therapy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEngineered monoclonal antibody tobevibart enhances HBsAg capture by Fc receptor-positive cells and activates HBV-specific T cells.\r\nWe demonstrate that tobevibart combines the advantages of potent neutralization of HBV and HDV with FcγR-mediated reduction of HBsAg and enhancement of T cell responses. Tobevibart is under clinical investigation alone or in combination with other agents to treat patients with chronic hepatitis delta and to induce functional cure of patients with CHB. Impact and implications () Chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or co-infection with hepatitis delta virus (HDV) can cause severe liver disease and cancer. We previously showed that the monoclonal antibody tobevibart potently neutralizes HBV and HDV. Here we demonstrate that the engineered Fc region of tobevibart effectively interacted with several immune cell types, potentially facilitating the rapid removal of damaging viral proteins from circulation and activating T cell responses that may control HBV infection long term. Clinical trial VIR-3434-1002, phase 1, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT04423393.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHealthy eating and physical activity significantly lower sex-specific alcohol-attributable liver mortality in the United States.\r\n Healthy eating and increased levels of PA significantly lower the risk of alcohol-attributable liver-related mortality in the US population. Impact and implications This study found that any amount of alcohol intake and binge drinking were associated with an increased risk of liver-related mortality. Adherence to healthy dietary patterns and increased physical activity lower the risk of liver mortality across al drinking patterns, including heavy and binge drinking. Liver survival benefits from both physical activity and diet quality are greater in women than men. A diet rich in vegetables, fruits, grains, seafood, plant-based proteins, and unsaturated fatty acids, combined with a reduced intake of empty calories from solid fats, alcohol, and added sugars, is associated with a lower risk of liver-related mortality. Economically disadvantaged populations are exposed to high-risk alcohol use, unhealthy diet, and physical inactivity, and therefore increased liver mortality.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRisk of alcohol-related liver disease and cause-specific mortality in individuals seeking treatment for alcohol use disorder.\r\n This study showed the substantial burden of alcohol-related disease and mortality in individuals seeking treatment for AUD. Specifically, the risk of ALD was 7% after 10 years, 13% in those with type 2 diabetes. Impact and implications Knowledge of the absolute risk of alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) and cause-specific death among individuals in treatment for alcohol use disorder is crucial to make decisions on screening for ALD. The study highlights the need for improved care of individuals in treatment for alcohol-use disorder to prevent morbidity and mortality due to ALD, other alcohol-related causes, but also cancer and cardiovascular disease. The higher risk of ALD in those with type 2 diabetes suggests that clinicians should be specifically aware of alcohol consumption and liver disease in their patients with type 2 diabetes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Editorial: A Step Back to Leap Forward-Strategic Nucleos(t)ide Analogue Discontinuation Towards HBV Functional Cure.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Time to Genotype-Genetic Risk and Prognosis in Steatotic Liver Disease.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    HIGH-RESOLUTION MANOMETRY IN TREATED ACHALASIA: SCOPING REVIEW AND NOVEL NOMENCLATURE.\r\nThis scoping review with expert recommendations provides guidance for HRM interpretation in treated achalasia and introduces novel descriptive terms to describe pathophysiology following achalasia treatment.

Stent placement reduces serum bilirubin more than EBD and is used in advanced PSC with severe strictures or EBD failure, potentially indicating more advanced disease.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Long-Term Follow-Up of Patients in a Prospective Study of NA Discontinuation Identifies Different Patterns of HBsAg Loss. \r\nALT flares were associated with HBsAg decline, and in some cases, with delayed HBsAg loss. The clinical study was supported by the National Health and Medical Research Council of the study clinical trial ID is NCT02581033.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTelemetric Assessment and Comparison of Regional Colonic Metabolic Activity in Ambulant Healthy Individuals Using pH and Gas-Sensing Wireless Motility Capsules. \r\nLuminal pH poorly reflects carbohydrate fermentation in the distal colon. ACTRN12619001219178 and ACTRN12622000422729.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nUnveiling Drug-Induced Autoimmune-Like Hepatitis in Autoimmune Hepatitis Patients: A Multicenter Retrospective Study. \r\nDI-ALH is often under-recognised in clinical practice, leading to unnecessary long-term immunosuppression. A causal relationship between drugs and AIH, along with an attempt to withdraw treatment and long-term follow-up, is essential to prevent overtreatment-associated risks.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAm J Gastroenterol\r\n    Accurate Non-endoscopic Detection of Early Esophageal Squamous Malignant Lesions Using Sponge-based Methylated DNA Biomarkers. \r\nThe AUCs for the complex model that included the two MDMs and Age were 0.961(95%CI, 0.920 to 1.000) and 0.940 (95%CI, 0.889 to 0.990) in the training and validation sets, respectively. The assay of MDMs in CCD samples offers a highly accurate method of predicting HGIN/ESCC, thereby providing the potential for early diagnosis and screening for HGIN/ESCC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAvoidant/restrictive eating in people with and without bowel symptoms in the general population: Prevalence, Clinical Profile and Associated Factors. \r\nAvoidant/restrictive eating is common in individuals with bowel symptoms and associated with a more severe clinical profile, indicating a need to discuss eating behavior with patients. However, avoidant/restrictive eating is also common in individuals in the general population without bowel symptoms.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDiagnostic Accuracy of Spleen-dedicated 100 Hz Transient Elastography to Predict High-risk Esophageal Varices. \r\nSSM alone can accurately predict HREV in cirrhosis, and its combination with LSM and PC precisely predicted CSPH, saving a significant number of endoscopies. The SSM cut-off to rule out HREV may vary with etiology.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDistinct Clinical Phenotypes in Lactase Non-Persistence: Symptomatic, Asymptomatic, and Gassy-Asymptomatic. \r\nclassifying LNP individuals into distinct subgroups and incorporating hydrogen production rate into breath-test interpretation may enhance diagnostic precision, prevent unnecessary dietary restrictions and generate new hypotheses linking fermentation kinetics and symptoms. Microbiome associations remain correlative and warrant functional validation in larger, controlled studies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEffect of oral proton pump inhibitor administration on reducing the delayed bleeding risk in five upper gastrointestinal endoscopic treatments. \r\nThe subgroup and sensitivity analyses almost consistently confirmed the main results. Oral PPI administration contributed to reducing delayed bleeding risk in G-EMR and G-ESD, but not in E-EMR, E-ESD, and PEG.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEvolution of Hepatitis A-Related Acute Liver Failure in North America Over 22 Years. \r\nOverall, the number of HAV ALF cases enrolled steeply declined. After 2010, when we began recording acute liver injury (ALI: INR ≥ 2 but no encephalopathy) an apparent increase in ALI incidence was noted, despite a near absence of ALF cases.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFatty pancreas disease and the risk of future diseases of the exocrine pancreas: a US matched cohort study. \r\nExtra-pancreatic cancer incidence did not differ. FPD is associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer, acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis, and incidental pancreatic cysts, independent of obesity or hepatic steatosis, suggesting a potentially causative role of FPD in the pathogenesis of exocrine pancreatic diseases.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFirst-Round Fecal Immunochemical Test Concentration Predicts Colorectal Cancer and Advanced Neoplasia in Second-Round Screening. \r\nClinicalTrials. gov number, NCT02078804.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIncreased mortality associated with sarcopenia in inflammatory bowel disease: a long-term prospective cohort study. \r\nProbable and confirmed sarcopenia increase the risk of long-term mortality in IBD patients. Sarcopenia assessment can help risk stratification for prognosis in older IBD patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNew Eczematous Eruption in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease Who Stop Janus Kinase Inhibitors. \r\n2 cases with biopsy-confirmed AD resolved after reinitiation of JAKi therapy and adjunct AD treatments. A subset of IBD patients may have latent susceptibility to AD, unmasked by therapy cessation and potentially triggered by an immune rebound effect.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSafety of Esophageal Dilation Procedures in Patients on Antithrombotic Therapy: A US Collaborative Network Cohort Study. \r\nDAPT was numerically associated with a higher risk of bleeding, but this did not reach statistical significance. These findings aim to inform the clinical decision-making in pre- and post-procedure management of esophageal dilation procedures.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTIMING THE SCAN: OPTIMIZING SCREENING FOR OSTEOPOROSIS AND RISK OF FRACTURE IN CELIAC DISEASE. \r\nHowever, their use should be weighed against an underdetection of clinically relevant BMD alterations. Tailoring DXA timing to healthcare resources and patient demographics may optimize outcomes and resource allocation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Portal Hypertension Decompensation Score - A Validated Predictive Model of Liver Decompensation Related to Portal Hypertension. \r\nThe PDS is an accurate predictor of decompensation in cACLD. It discriminates patients who are low-risk from those who are high-risk and who may benefit from further evaluation or treatment, without requiring the use of LSM.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe impact of integrating pelvic MRI at diagnosis on early detection of perianal Crohn's disease in pediatrics. \r\nThese patients needed more and earlier perianal surgery and had higher biologic use despite their perianal disease being subclinical. Adding routine MR imaging at time of pediatric CD diagnosis may help inform treatment decisions and improve these outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Accelerated vs Step-Up Endoscopic Treatment for Pancreatic Walled-Off Necrosis: A Randomized Controlled Trial (ACCELERATE). \r\n(ClinicalTrials. gov, Number NCT05601687).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nArtificial Intelligence for Quantifying Endoscopic Mucosal Ulceration in Crohn's Disease. \r\nPerformance of CVE for CD was similar in the SEAVUE validation cohort. CVE provides a means for automated ulceration and mucosal injury quantitation that shows conceptual agreement with SES-CD and offers new capabilities to improve the granularity and personalization of endoscopic disease assessment in CD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEfficacy and Safety of HSK31679 in Asian Patients with MASLD: A Randomized Controlled Trial. \r\nIn Asian MASLD patients, HSK31679 was well tolerated, with significant reductions in LFC after 12 weeks of treatment with 80 mg and 160 mg. NCT05795517.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReal-world comparison of the effectiveness of tofacitinib and ustekinumab in patients with ulcerative colitis: the TORUS study. \r\nTofacitinib and ustekinumab are similarly effective to induce and maintain CFREM after anti-TNF failure in UC. However, tofacitinib could be favored in case of multiple therapeutic failures (≥ 3 biologics) and primary failure to any biologic.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopy\r\n    Endoscopic management of refractory gastrointestinal-tracheobronchial fistulas with two novel occluders: a comparative cohort study.\r\nAll procedure-related AEs were mild, occurring in five DU (13.9%) and three MU patients (6.0%). The MU occluder showed greater potential for sustained occlusion than the DU occluder and may be a viable option for refractory GI-tracheobronchial fistulas, although further prospective studies are needed.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReducing the environmental impact of gastrointestinal endoscopy: a prospective study on waste management through waste segregation and staff education.\r\nTargeted interventions such as staff education and structured waste segregation protocols substantially reduced RMW and associated GHG emissions in a high-volume endoscopy unit. These results suggest that simple, low-cost changes may improve environmental sustainability in clinical practice.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSTAndardization of Reports (the STAR project) Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy: European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) Quality Improvement Initiative. \r\nA suggestion for a normal findings report is provided. Standardized reporting could enhance the quality of UGI endoscopy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTraining esophagogastroduodenoscopy skills: a randomized multicenter trial comparing simulation-based training versus clinical training.\r\nSBT prior to CBT reduces the number of supervised procedures required to achieve independent procedural completion without negatively affecting patient satisfaction or increasing training costs. These findings support the routine implementation of SBT when learning EGD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nWater consumption before-and-after simple intervention using infographic poster during bowel preparation for colonoscopy: A prospective observational study. \r\nNo significant differences were observed in fluid intake or bowel cleansing quality. The educational poster intervention promoting appropriate flush selection during bowel preparation may be a simple option for reducing water consumption, leading to green endoscopy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Implications of shame for patient reported outcomes in Bowel Disorders of Gut-Brain Interaction. \r\nShame appears to be a particularly important emotion deriving from the experience of GI symptoms in Bowel DGBI, influencing the associations between these symptoms and important patient reported outcomes. An empathetic doctor-patient relationship and psychological therapies may be helpful for individuals with Bowel DGBI experiencing high levels of shame.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    Clinical utility of suprapapillary plastic stents for lifelong biliary drainage in unresectable malignant hilar biliary obstruction. \r\nSPPS, as the first stent for unresectable MHBO, was considered superior to SEMS for the intermittent maintenance of LBD. Achieving LBD success or extending TLBDF may help preserve therapeutic options.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nComparison of endoscopic band ligation versus over-the-scope clip for colonic diverticular bleeding: A propensity score-matched cohort analysis. \r\nNo significant differences in initial hemostasis, requirements for IVR or surgery, requirements of red blood cell transfusion, and adverse events were observed between the two groups. OTSC was more effective than EBL for reducing early recurrent bleeding rate in endoscopic hemostasis for CDB.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFocused communication Three-dimensional volume estimates of pancreatic fluid collections in relation to clinical outcomes of endoscopic ultrasound-guided treatment. \r\nThe maximum diameter represented a comparable model goodness-of-fit. PFC volume was associated with the outcomes of EUS-guided interventions, and the maximum diameter may be a reasonable surrogate.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOptimal Interval of Screening Endoscopy for Reducing Gastric Cancer Mortality: A Nationwide Cohort Study. \r\nPatients who underwent screening at intervals ≤3 years had a significantly reduced risk of GC-specific mortality compared to those screened at intervals >3 years. A 3-year screening interval may be an effective strategy for high-risk regions.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPerformance comparison of quantitative and qualitative fecal immunochemical tests in community-based colorectal cancer screening. \r\nQnFIT exhibited lower positivity, higher DR at colonoscopy and PPV for CRC over qlFIT. Almost half of colonoscopy resources were saved by qnFIT, although adenoma and polyp were missed in population screening.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    Comparative risk of high-risk neoplasia after polypectomy among individuals aged below 50 years versus 50 years and older. \r\nAmong screened individuals, in both age groups, the association was particularly strong for individuals with index high-risk lesions and peaked at 3 years after polypectomy, with HRs (95% CI) of 4.60 (3.63 to 5.84) and 5.59 (3.89 to 8.03) for young adults with index high-risk adenoma and high-risk SPs, respectively. Patients undergoing polypectomy at a screening colonoscopy below age 50 years exhibited a similarly increased risk of metachronous neoplasia as those aged ≥50 years, suggesting that current surveillance guidelines developed in old adults may apply to young adults.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSingle-cell multimodal analysis reveals the dynamic immunopathogenesis of HBV-ACLF progression. \r\nSix immune cellular modules (CMs) were identified for patient stratification, with CM2 and CM6 showing strong predictive value for disease outcomes, and CM3 indicating a potential early therapeutic window. Our longitudinal multiomics study revealed the dynamic evolution of the immune response in HBV-ACLF and characterised diverse immune patterns for the future precise management and therapeutic intervention.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSmoking affects gut immune system of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases by modulating metabolomic profiles and mucosal microbiota. \r\nWe demonstrated that smoking affects the gut immune system by modulating mucosal microbiota. Our findings provide insights into how smoking can have beneficial or detrimental effects on UC or CD, respectively, and may shed light on the reasons why individuals with UC who quit smoking experience disease exacerbation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    A novel mechanism involving USP53-regulated BSEP trafficking underlies low-GGT intrahepatic cholestasis.\r\nLoss of USP53 interaction with MYO5B and its p.(Arg824Cys) variant impaired BSEP trafficking in USP53- and MYO5B-asociated low-GGT intrahepatic cholestasis. These results provide a novel mechanism that underlies USP53-PFIC and implicates USP53 in the pathogenesis of MYO5B-PFIC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCX3CR1+ macrophages interact with HSCs to promote HCC through CD8+ T-cell suppression. \r\nMoreover, genetic deficiency of CX3CR1 in myeloid cells or pharmacological inhibition of retinol metabolism remarkably attenuated HCC development. We showed that CX3CR1+Ly6C+ macrophages migrate and interact with aHSCs in the peritumoral region where retinoids induce arginase-1 expression in CX3CR1+Ly6C+ macrophages, subsequently depriving CD8+ T cells of arginine and promoting HCC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nDistinct immune microenvironment of venous tumor thrombus in hepatocellular carcinoma at single-cell resolution. \r\nTAMs, especially C5aR+ TAMs, were enriched in PVTT. C5aR+ TAMs contribute to the development of PVTT and poor prognosis by reshaping the immunosuppressive environment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nGenomic and the tumor microenvironment heterogeneity in multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma. \r\nAdditionally, MMP9+ tumor-associated macrophages were enriched across IM and MO, which formed cellular niches with regulatory T cells and proliferative/exhausted T cells. Our findings deeply decipher the heterogeneous TMEs between IM and MO, which provide a comprehensive landscape of multifocal HCC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nHuman-induced pluripotent stem cell-based hepatic modeling of lipid metabolism-associated TM6SF2-E167K variant. \r\nOur findings indicate that induced hepatocytes generated from human-induced pluripotent stem cells carrying the TM6SF2-E167K recapitulate the effects observed in human hepatocytes from individuals with the TM6SF2 mutation. This study characterizes an in vitro model that can be used as a platform to identify potential clinical targets and highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting protein misfolding to alleviate ER stress and mitigate the detrimental effects of the TM6SF2-E167K mutation on hepatic lipid metabolism.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nNon-Invasive Tests: Establishing efficacy for metabolic dysfunction associated steatohepatitis beyond the biopsy-current perspectives from the division of hepatology and nutrition, US Food and Drug Administration. \r\nThis communication is intended to provide some of the regulatory considerations on adopting non-invasive tests in lieu of liver histology as a RLSE in drug development for MASH. We will also describe FDA mechanisms and the methods by which data can be submitted to the FDA to consider proposals for NIT use in place of liver histology as RLSEs.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPlasma FSTL-1 as a noninvasive diagnostic biomarker for patients with advanced liver fibrosis. \r\nA cutoff value ≤ 0.43 ng/mL was the optimal rule-out threshold, with a sensitivity of 84.62% (95% CI, 76.46%-90.30%) and a specificity of 79.51% (95% CI, 74.81%-83.53%), while ≥0.50 ng/mL was the best rule-in threshold, with a specificity of 86.41% (95% CI, 81.06%-90.43%) and a sensitivity of 70.67% (95% CI, 64.41%-76.23%). Plasma FSTL-1 has high diagnostic accuracy and could potentially reduce the need for liver biopsy in identifying patients with advanced liver fibrosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nValue of HCC surveillance in a landscape of emerging surveillance options: Perspectives of a multi-stakeholder modified Delphi panel. \r\nThe panel acknowledged performance metrics of emerging methods may differ from other cancer screening programs given differences in populations, including higher risk of cancer development and competing risk of morality, and differences in diagnostic workflow in patients at risk of HCC. These data provide insights into the perceived value of HCC surveillance in an era of emerging blood- and imaging-based surveillance strategies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Claudin-1 is a mediator and therapeutic target in primary sclerosing cholangitis. \r\nThe results of this preclinical study pave the way for the clinical development of Claudin-1-specific antibodies for the treatment of PSC. It is therefore of impact for physicians, scientists and drug developers in the field of biliary disease.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEffect of Hypertension on Long-term Adverse Clinical Outcomes and Liver Fibrosis Progression in MASLD. \r\nSubgroup and sensitivity analyses supported these findings.
