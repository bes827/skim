For an effective primary prevention of HCC, a comprehensive approach should be required to modify both metabolic dysfunction and alcohol intake habit.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndosc Int Open\r\n    Assessment of colonoscopy skill using machine learning to measure quality: Proof-of-concept and initial validation.\r\nAn interactive AI assessment of colonoscopy skill can automatically assess quality. We propose that this tool can be utilized to rapidly identify and train providers in need of remediation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nIncomplete small bowel capsule endoscopy: Risk factors and cost-effectiveness of real-time viewing.\r\nModern devices make incomplete SBCE rare, usually not tied to prolonged GTT. In a low-incidence scenario, widespread RTV use brings high costs and uncertain effectiveness.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nPrognostic impact of deprivation on esophagogastroduodenoscopy outcome.\r\ninfection, and 12-fold more severe esophagitis, and more advanced cancer stage.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nQuality of endoscopic surveillance of Lynch syndrome patients in a Swedish cohort.\r\nAdenoma detection was associated with older age and male sex. The results indicate the need for better adherence to guidelines and attention to older age groups, men, and patients with obesity.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nEndoscopy\r\n    Detection of colorectal cancer and advanced neoplasia during first surveillance interval after detection of adenomas in fecal immunochemical test cancer screening: a nationwide study.\r\n CRC detection was lower among participants rated at higher risk at initial CRC screening. Findings at first screen-derived colonoscopy might not be as good a predictor of CRC risk in a FIT-positive screening population.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEUS-guided entero-colostomy with Lumen Apposing Metal Stent as a rescue treatment for malignant intestinal occlusion: a multicentre study.\r\nEUS-EC is a feasible technique and could be considered as a possible alternative to standard approaches for MIO in highly selected patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPolyp size is associated with colorectal cancer death across histologic polyp subtypes: a retrospective study of a screening colonoscopy registry.\r\nAcross al histologic types, participants with polyps ≥10 mm had at least a two-fold increase in the likelihood of PCCRC death compared with those with polyps <10 mm. These data suggest that size, rather than histologic subtype, should be a determinant for risk stratification after screening colonoscopy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Fazirsiran for Adults with Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency Liver Disease: A Phase 2 Placebo Controlled Trial (SEQUOIA).\r\nFazirsiran reduced serum and liver concentrations of Z-AAT in a dose dependent manner and reduced hepatic globule burden (NCT03945292).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    Appropriate trust in artificial intelligence for the optical diagnosis of colorectal polyps: The role of human/artificial intelligence interaction.\r\nAppropriate trust was common and CADx prediction utilization was highest for the optional CADx without confidence scores. These results express the importance of a better understanding of human-AI interaction.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRisk of stricture after endoscopic submucosal dissection in the cervical esophagus and efficacy of local steroid injection for stricture prevention.\r\nPatients who underwent ≥ ½ circumferential resection were at high risk of cervical esophageal stricture. Steroid injection had a stricture-prevention effect in patients with < ¾ and ≥ ½ circumferential resection, but seemed to be insufficient in preventing stricture in patients with ≥ ¾ circumferential resection.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTEMPORARY REMOVAL: Quality indicators common to all GI endoscopic procedures.\r\nA replacement will appear as soon as possible in which the reason for the removal of the article will be specified, or the article will be reinstated. The full Elsevier Policy on Article Withdrawal can be found at\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    Cold versus hot snare endoscopic mucosal resection for large (≥15 mm) flat non-pedunculated colorectal polyps: a randomised controlled trial.\r\n Compared with H-EMR, C-EMR for flat, adenomatous LNPCPs, demonstrates superior safety with equivalent technical success. However, endoscopic recurrence is significantly greater for cold snare resection and is currently a limitation of the technique.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut microbiota signatures of vulnerability to food addiction in mice and humans.\r\n By understanding the crosstalk between this behavioural alteration and gut microbiota, these findings constitute a step forward to future treatments for food addiction and related eating disorders.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIntegrated metagenomic and metabolomic analysis reveals distinctive stage-specific gut-microbiome-derived metabolites in intracranial aneurysms.\r\n Our investigation highlights the potential of gut-microbiome-derived tryptophan metabolites as biomarkers for distinguishing RIA from UIA patients. The findings suggest a novel pathogenic role for gut-microbiome-derived IS in elastin degradation in the IA wall leading to the rupture of IA.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMultiple indicators of gut dysbiosis predict all-cause and cause-specific mortality in solid organ transplant recipients.\r\n Gut dysbiosis is consistently associated with mortality in SOTR. Our results support the observations that gut dysbiosis is associated with long-term survival. Since our data do not allow us to infer causality, more preclinical research is needed to understand mechanisms before we can determine whether gut microbiome-directed therapies may be designed to improve long-term outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPancreatic STAT5 activation promotes KrasG12D-induced and inflammation-induced acinar-to-ductal metaplasia and pancreatic cancer.\r\n Collectively, our findings identified pancreatic STAT5 activation as a key downstream effector of oncogenic KRAS signalling that is critical for ADM initiation and PDAC progression, highlighting its potential therapeutic vulnerability.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    A novel phosphodiesterase inhibitor for the treatment of chronic liver injury and metabolic diseases.\r\nIn conclusion, we synthesized and demonstrated that MDL3, a novel PDE4B and PDE5A inhibitor, presents a promising avenue of exploration for treating CLD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAlcohol-associated liver disease and public health policies.\r\nIn this narrative review, we will review major US national as well as worldwide alcohol related public health policies with a particular focus on describing how such policies have influenced rates of ALD and its complications and outcomes. We will describe global alcohol public health policy frameworks, review key alcohol policy models, describe existing notable policies and their impacts, and highlight gaps in ALD policy literature where further research and policy interventions could reduce rates mortality from ALD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIntegrated and collaborative care across the spectrum of alcohol-associated liver disease and alcohol use disorder.\r\nHere, we review the role of AUD care in ALD treatment, the effects of AUD treatment on liver-related outcomes, the impact of comorbid conditions such as other substance use disorders, obesity, and metabolic syndrome, the current landscape of integrated and collaborative care for ALD and AUD in various treatment settings. We further review knowledge gaps and unmet needs that remain, including the role of precision medicine, the application of harm reduction approaches, the impact of health disparities, the need for additional AUD treatment options as well as further efforts to support implementation and dissemination.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPerformance of spleen stiffness measurement to rule out high-risk varices in patients with porto-sinusoidal vascular disorder.\r\n This study gathering a total of 309 PSVD patients showed that SSM-VCTE ≤40 kPa combined with bilirubin <1 mg/dL identifies patients with PSVD and portal hypertension with a probability of HRV <5%, in whom screening endoscopy can be spared.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReduction of Z alpha-1 antitrypsin polymers in human iPSC-hepatocytes and mice by LRRK2 inhibitors.\r\nMechanistically, this effect was achieved through induction of autophagy. Our findings support the use of CZC-25146 and LRRK2 inhibitors in hepatic proteinopathy research and their further investigation as novel therapeutic candidates for A1ATD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRole of Point-of-Care ultrasound (POCUS) in clinical hepatology.\r\nRenal ultrasound can identify renal and post-renal causes of AKI and aid in diagnosis of pre-renal AKI through volume assessment. In this review, we address the principles and methods of POCUS in hospitalized patients and in outpatients with cirrhosis and discuss the application of this diverse modality in clinical hepatology.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Differing genetic variants associated with liver fat and their contrasting relationships with cardiovascular diseases and cancer.\r\n This study provides fresh insight into the heterogeneous effect of liver fat on health outcomes. It challenges the notion that liver fat per se is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, underscoring the dependency of this association on the specific mechanisms that drive fat accumulation in the liver. However, excess liver fat, regardless of how achieved, appears to be causally linked to liver cirrhosis and cancers in a dose dependent manner. Impact and implication This research advances our understanding of the heterogeneity in mechanisms influencing liver fat accumulation, providing new insights into how liver fat accumulation may impact various health outcomes. The findings challenge the notion that liver fat is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and highlight the mechanistic effect of some genetic variants on fat accumulation and the development of cardiovascular diseases. This study is of particular importance for healthcare professionals including physicians and researchers as well as patients as it allows for more targeted and personalised treatment by understanding the relationship between liver fat and various health outcomes. The findings emphasise the need for a personalised management approach and a reshaping of risk assessment criteria. It also provides room for prioritising a clinical intervention aimed at reducing liver fat content (likely by intentional weight loss, however, achieved) that could help protect against liver related fibrosis and cancer.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHistological predictors of aggressive recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma after liver resection.\r\n The presence of mVI/S was the only independent risk factor for aggressive recurrence and mortality. This has important implications for early-stage patient management, especially in the setting of adjuvant immunotherapy or ab initio LT.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMetabolic phenotyping of patients with Advanced Chronic Liver Disease for better characterization of Cirrhosis Regression.\r\nWe identified and validated a group of lipid biomarkers associated with regression of fibrosis that could be used as non-invasive biomarker for detecting regression of fibrosis in cACLD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNeuropilin-1 is a novel host factor modulating the entry of hepatitis B virus.\r\nOur findings indicate that NRP1 is a novel host factor for HBV infection, which interacts with preS1 and NTCP to modulate HBV entry into hepatocytes. Impact and implications HBV infection is a global public health problem, but the understanding of the early infection process of HBV remains limited. Through single-cell sequencing, we identified a novel host factor, NRP1, which modulates HBV entry by interacting with HBV preS1 and NTCP. Moreover, antagonists targeting NRP1 can inhibit HBV infection both in vitro and in vivo. This study could further advance our comprehension of the early infection process of HBV.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nType-I interferon shapes peritoneal immunity in cirrhosis and drives caspase-5-mediated progranulin release upon infection.\r\nType-I IFN shapes peritoneal immune responses and regulates caspase-5-mediated progranulin release during SBP. Impact and implications Patients with cirrhosis exhibit impaired immune responses and increased susceptibility to bacterial infections. This study reveals that type-I interferon responses, triggered by pathogen-associated molecular patterns, are crucial in regulating macrophage activation and priming them for inflammatory responses. Additionally, we elucidate the mechanisms by which type-I interferons promote the release of progranulin from macrophages during spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Our findings enhance understanding of how bacterial translocation affects immune responses, identify novel biomarkers for inflammasome activation during infections, and point to potential therapeutic targets.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Editorial: Disorders of gut-brain interaction-Don't forget the older person.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Editorial on FODMAPs in IBS: Revisiting Restriction.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopy\r\n    ESGE and Social Media in the 21st Century.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nVisualized biliary cannulation during ERCP: do we really need it?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Deconstructing the \"pain\" points when considering the impact of Brain Gut Behavior Therapies on IBS.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTargeting the IL-23 Pathway in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\nFurthermore, we address available data on the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of IL-23-specific p19-inhibitors in the treatment of IBD and discuss important studies performed in other immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.

Clinical guidelines should emphasize the addition of aerobic exercise in lifestyle treatments for the greatest histologic benefit in individuals with advanced MASH. Clinical trial number NCT03151798.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHistological predictors of aggressive recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma after liver resection.\r\n The presence of mVI/S was the only independent risk factor for aggressive recurrence and mortality. This has important implications for early-stage patient management, especially in the setting of adjuvant immunotherapy or ab initio LT.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nProcoagulant phenotype of virus-infected pericytes is associated with portal thrombosis and intrapulmonary vascular dilations in fatal COVID-19.\r\nSARS-CoV-2 infection of liver pericytes elicits a local procoagulant response associated with extensive portal microthrombosis, IPVD and worsening respiratory failure in fatal COVID-19. Impact and implications Vascular involvement of the liver represents a serious complication of COVID-19 infection that must be considered in the work-up of patients with long-lasting and progressively worsening respiratory failure, as it may associate with the development of intrapulmonary vascular dilations. This clinical picture is associated with a pro-coagulant phenotype of portal venule pericytes, which is induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection of pericytes. Both observations provide a model that may apply, at least in part, to other vascular disorders of the liver, featuring obliterative portal venopathy, similarly characterized at the clinical level by development of hypoxemia and at the histological level, by phlebosclerosis and reduced caliber of the portal vein branches in the absence of cirrhosis. Moreover, our findings bring light to an as yet overlooked player of thrombosis pathophysiology, i.e. pericytes, which may provide novel therapeutic tools to halt prothrombotic mechanisms.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSex and ethnic disparities in hepatitis B evaluation and treatment across the world.\r\nEvaluation and treatment rates were suboptimal for patients with CHB in both the East and West, with significant sex and ethnic disparities. Improved linkage to care with linguistically competent and culturally sensitive approaches is needed. Impact and implications Significant sex and ethnic disparities exist in hepatitis B evaluation and treatment, with female treatment-eligible patients about 50% less likely to receive antiviral treatment and Asian patients from Western regions also about 50% less likely to receive adequate evaluation or treatment compared to Asians from the East (there was no significant difference between Asian patients from the East and non-Asian patients). Improved linkage to care with linguistically competent and culturally sensitive approaches is needed.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) polymorphisms may influence HDV RNA load and early response to bulevirtide.\r\nNTCP genetic polymorphisms were identified by Sanger sequencing. Results Of the 6 NTCP polymorphisms studied in 209 CHD untreated patients, carriers of rs17556915 TT/CC (N=142) compared to CT (N=67) genotype presented higher median HDV RNA levels (5.39 vs 4.75 log T genetic polymorphisms may influence baseline HDV RNA load both in untreated and BLV treated patients with CHD and may contribute to identify patients with different early virological responses to BLV.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nType-I interferon shapes peritoneal immunity in cirrhosis and drives caspase-5-mediated progranulin release upon infection.\r\nType-I IFN shapes peritoneal immune responses and regulates caspase-5-mediated progranulin release during SBP. Impact and implications Patients with cirrhosis exhibit impaired immune responses and increased susceptibility to bacterial infections. This study reveals that type-I interferon responses, triggered by pathogen-associated molecular patterns, are crucial in regulating macrophage activation and priming them for inflammatory responses. Additionally, we elucidate the mechanisms by which type-I interferons promote the release of progranulin from macrophages during spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Our findings enhance understanding of how bacterial translocation affects immune responses, identify novel biomarkers for inflammasome activation during infections, and point to potential therapeutic targets.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Editorial: Genetics for non-invasive risk stratification-Finding the needle in the haystack?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Reading the cholate: A new gateway to portal hypertension and oesophageal varices.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndosc Int Open\r\n    Retention of endoscopic capsules in diverticula: Literature review of a capsule endoscopy rarity.\r\nThe most common type is Meckel's diverticulum, and endoscopy is the primary management.

Impact and implications In this cross-sectional study, data from 7,918 participants who underwent MRE were analyzed to assess the performance of fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis scores in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and MASLD with increased alcohol intake (MetALD). We found that the newly identified MetALD group had high diagnostic accuracy with FIB-4, similar to the MASLD population. These results highlight the potential of FIB-4 as a reliable screening tool for MetALD, even when specific subgroups are considered. Therefore, FIB-4 is a valuable screening tool for identifying advanced fibrosis in the MetALD population.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEpigenetic scars in regulatory T cells are retained after successful treatment of chronic hepatitis C with direct-acting antivirals.\r\nHere we longitudinally examined phenotypic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic alterations in peripheral blood regulatory T (T cells are maintained at phenotypic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic levels even after successful DAA treatment. Further in-depth studies are required to investigate the long-term clinical outcomes of patients who have recovered from chronic HCV infection.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPrimary cilia as a targetable node between biliary injury, senescence and regeneration in liver transplantation.\r\nPrimary cilia play an essential role in biliary regeneration and we demonstrate that senolytics and cilia-stabilising treatments provide a potential therapeutic opportunity to reduce the rate of biliary complications and improve clinical outcomes in liver transplantation. Impact and implications Up to 25% of liver transplants result in biliary complications, leading to additional surgery, retransplants, or death. We found that the incidence of biliary complications is increased by damage to the primary cilium, an antenna that protrudes from the cell and is key to regeneration. Here, we show that treatments that preserve the primary cilia during the transplant process provide a potential solution to reduce the rates of biliary complications.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) polymorphisms may influence HDV RNA load and early response to bulevirtide.\r\nNTCP genetic polymorphisms were identified by Sanger sequencing.

Clinical trial number;  ClinicalTrials.gov identifier  NCT05296733. Impact and implications Survodutide is a glucagon receptor/glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor dual agonist in development for treatment of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), which causes cirrhosis in ∼20% of cases. This trial delineates the pharmacokinetic and safety profile of survodutide in people with compensated or decompensated cirrhosis, and revealed associated reductions in liver fat content, markers of liver fibrosis and body weight. These findings have potential relevance for people with MASH-including those with decompensated cirrhosis, who are usually excluded from clinical trials of investigational drugs.

Organellar interfaces permit co-regulation of lipid metabolism to match generation of potentially toxic lipid species with their LD depot storage.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Presentation of the 2024 AGA Distinguished Achievement Award in Basic Science to Jerrold R.

Finally, we highlight the need of considering individual parameters such as sex and disease stage in the development of NR-based clinical strategies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOpening the doors of precision medicine: novel tools to assess intestinal barrier in inflammatory bowel disease and colitis-associated neoplasia.\r\nNovel molecules, dietary interventions and microbiome modulation strategies aim to restore, reinforce, or modulate the gut-brain axis. These advancements have the potential for transformative and personalised approaches to managing IBD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Immunotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma: the next evolution in expanding access to liver transplantation.\r\nUltimately, the goal of immunotherapy in this population will be to effectively expand access to liver transplantation while preserving pre- and post-transplant outcomes. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms supporting combination immunotherapy, summarize key recent clinical data from major immunotherapy trials, and explore how immunotherapy can be applied in the neoadjuvant setting prior to liver transplantation in selected high-risk patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIntegration of new technologies in the multidisciplinary approach to primary liver tumours: The next-generation tumour board.\r\nNavigating this evolution also requires a focus on enhancing basic, translational, and clinical research, as well as boosting clinical trials through an upgraded use of MDTBs as hubs for scientific collaboration and raising literacy about AI and new technologies. In this review, we will delineate the current unmet needs in the clinical management of primary liver cancers, discuss our perspective on the future role of MDTBs in primary liver cancers (\"next generation\" MDTBs), and unravel the potential power and limitations of novel technologies that may shape the multidisciplinary care landscape for primary liver cancers in the coming decade.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous\r\nmisc publications eg case reports, tools of the trade, images of\r\nthe month, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Gastroenterol\r\n
