Compared to patients without clinical diagnosis of DD, patients with DD had significantly lower rectoanal pressure gradient (RAG) (median -34.7 [IQR -57.1, -13.0] vs -24.6 [IQR -44.5, -2.4] mmHg, p=0.009) and more abnormal BET (59.5% vs 11.8%, p 80% PPV for diagnosing DD in patients with chronic constipation.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol\n    6-Mercaptopurine vs. Mycophenolate Mofetil in Autoimmune Hepatitis and Azathioprine Intolerance: A Multicenter Study.\nBoth 6-MP and MMF were capable of maintaining biochemical response in patients with AIH who were intolerant to AZA, with no clear evidence of inferiority of either treatment. While MMF was generally better tolerated, 6-MP may present a safe and effective treatment option in women of reproductive age. In addition, therapy with 6-MP enables clinicians to monitor drug metabolite levels, titrate dosages, and monitor adherence.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Endosc Int Open\n    Characteristics and causes of post-endoscopy Barrett's neoplasia: Retrospective multicenter study.\nPEBN occurring in LSBE was mostly overlooked because of inadequate observation, whereas PEBN at the 0 to 3 o'clock position in SSBE was frequently misdiagnosed as esophagitis. Bearing these results in mind may improve quality of endoscopic screening and reduce incidence of PEBN.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMCEndoscopic submucosal dissection for early gastric cancer in the elderly: Spanish multicenter prospective study during initial experience.\nOctogenarians with EGC benefit from ESD in a Western setting in terms of disease-free survival, but have lower long-term survival due to comorbidities, underscoring the importance of pre-procedure risk assessment. ESD is a proven safe technique, but in the subgroup of patients aged ≥ 80 years with severe comorbidities (ASA-PS ≥ IV), periprocedural mortality is increased and the indication should be carefully evaluated.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMCEndoscopic ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation for large branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms: Safety and efficacy trial.\nEUS-RFA in large, predominantly multilocular BD-IPMNs shows promising volumetric efficacy. Safety may be improved through refined energy delivery and technical advances. Molecular response remains exploratory and requires further validation. Long-term studies assessing progression-free outcomes are needed to define its role as an organ-preserving therapeutic option.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMCPredictors of non-compliance with post-procedure follow-up after endoscopic stent placement.\nPatient-specific risk factors for non-compliance of stent removal were identified.

Targeting the NSUN6-CCL2 axis represents a promising strategy to sensitise PDAC to ICB therapy.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Hepatology\n    Genomic and transcriptomic profiling of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with Fontan-associated liver disease.\nGenomic mutational profiles of FALD and non-Fontan CHS HCCs are distinct from HCCs with other etiologies. Copy number alterations and transcriptional profiles in FALD HCCs classified these into a poor-prognosis group of HCCs.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Stroma-driven inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity of PD-L1 expression in cholangiocarcinoma: Implications for biomarker development and prognostic evaluation.\n Our data indicate that stroma content may be a surrogate for inflamed iCCA. Moreover, the inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity of iCCA poses a significant challenge to interpreting the PD-L1 signal. To establish tissue-based biomarkers in iCCA, a more granular annotation of their expression in different intratumoral compartments will be critical.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx J Hepatol\n    A single-cell atlas of the woodchuck liver reveals cellular programs conserved in human HBV infection.\nWe present a multi-omic atlas of healthy, diseased, and ex vivo-stimulated woodchuck liver. This work identified shared WHV-HBV pathological processes, reinforces the value of this preclinical model and provides a resource to advance HBV pathogenesis studies and therapeutic development. Impact and implications Limited treatment options for liver disease, often requiring liver transplantation, emphasize the need for human-relevant animal models to speed the development of new therapeutic interventions. Woodchucks infected with woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) develop chronic hepatitis and liver cancer, similar to human hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. However, the composition and active biological processes in woodchuck hepatic cells were poorly understood, limiting the utility of this model to therapeutic discovery. In this study, we characterized the healthy and chronically infected woodchuck liver in comparison to human HBV at a single-cell resolution reinforcing the potential of WHV-infected woodchuck as a model for human HBV disease.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx AF6 knockout-induced upregulation of bile acid production promotes CXCL14-mediated antitumor immunity in HCC: Effect of the BA/Butyrate/CXCL14 axis in HCC.\nAF6 modulates primary BA synthesis, driving gut microbiota-dependent butyrate production and Cxcl14-mediated immune remodeling in HCC. This axis highlights a novel mechanism linking BA metabolism, gut microbiota, and immune regulation, offering potential therapeutic targets for liver cancer treatment. Impact and implications This study establishes that hepatic Af6 deficiency restrains hepatocarcinogenesis via a BA-driven, microbiota-dependent butyrate-CXCL14 axis. This axis highlights a novel mechanism linking BA metabolism, gut microbiota, and immune regulation, providing potential therapeutic targets for liver cancer treatment. This research represents the first mouse model in which induces the generation of primary BAs is potentiated without associated alterations in the typical epithelial morphology. We expect that this model will be of use in monitoring BA-related pathological processes in the gastrointestinal tract, including cancer progression.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Incidence and implications of abstinence-induced recompensation in alcohol-related cirrhosis.\nAlcohol abstinence enabled recompensation in one third of patients with decompensated alcohol-related cirrhosis, particularly with early abstinence and absence of further decompensation. Recompensation led to a significant survival benefit with maintained abstinence, with a negligible residual risk of liver-related death and HCC. Impact and implications Hepatic recompensation, as defined by Baveno VII, is a novel clinical concept reflecting the potential for disease regression and resolution of decompensating events in patients with cirrhosis once the underlying aetiological factor is removed or controlled. In this multicentre study, sustained alcohol abstinence led to recompensation in one third of patients with decompensated alcohol-related cirrhosis within 5 years, particularly if abstinence was achieved early and in the absence of further decompensation. Recompensation markedly improved outcomes, with a negligible residual risk of liver-related death and hepatocellular carcinoma when abstinence is maintained. These findings support personalised treatment approaches in decompensated alcohol-related cirrhosis by helping identify patients at risk of progression or with potential for regression.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Updated data from IMbrave050: Adjuvant atezolizumab plus bevacizumab for high-risk hepatocellular carcinoma.\nIn this updated analysis, the initial RFS benefit seen with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab vs active surveillance was not sustained and OS remained immature. The safety profile of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab remained manageable and consistent with that of each agent and the underlying disease. Overall, the benefit-risk profile does not support atezolizumab plus bevacizumab as adjuvant therapy. Clinical trial number NCT04102098 IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS  Based on results from the IMbrave150 trial, atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab is the standard-of-care first-line treatment for unresectable HCC, prompting interest in investigating the combination in earlier treatment settings. IMbrave050 was the first immunotherapy study to report data in the adjuvant setting for HCC, where an early RFS benefit was observed at the pre-specified interim analysis but not maintained with longer follow-up;  overall survival remained immature. The updated results of IMbrave050 do not support the use of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab in the adjuvant setting. However, subgroup analyses suggest a potential benefit in select patients, warranting further prospective evaluation. Effective perioperative or adjuvant treatment remains a major unmet need for patients with HCC given the high rate of early post-operative relapse.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Yttrium-90 radioembolization is associated with a lower risk of liver transplant waitlist dropout than chemoembolization in hepatocellular carcinoma.\nIn a large national cohort of liver transplant candidates with HCC, TARE compared to TACE as first LRT was associated with higher rates of complete necrosis on explant, lower likelihood of multiple LRTs, and lower risk of waitlist dropout. Impact and implications With nearly al hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients in the US now receiving local regional therapies (LRT), better understanding of the optimal LRT type to achieve tumor control and maintain tumor stage is needed. In this contemporary study of over 5000 patients using the US national database (UNOS), we showed that trans-arterial radioembolization (TARE) may be the preferred bridging therapy over chemoembolization (TACE) based on a significantly lower probability of waitlist dropout after controlling for liver function and tumor characteristics. Additionally, TARE treated patients demonstrated higher probability of complete pathologic response and reduced tumor under-staging on explant, which taken together strongly suggests that TARE is a more effective tumor treatment compared to TACE.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \n\n\nReviews&Editorials\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\npublisher website using the provided link\n\n\n    Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol\n    Blue Notes.\n\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Knowledge, Attitudes, and Environment Related to Gastroenterology and Hepatology Care for Sexual and Gender Minorities.\n\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Gut\n    Shaping the future of postoperative recurrence in Crohn's disease: personalised approaches with AI-enabled imaging and multi-omics.\nWhile promising, these innovations require prospective validation, methodological standardisation and integration into clinical workflows before translation into routine practice.

Impacts and implications HBV sequence polymorphisms can lead to antiviral resistance for the treatment of chronic HBV infection. Therefore, it is important for HCPs to understand the prevalence and development of bepirovirsen binding site SNPs and how their presence in patients with chronic HBV infection may impact the virological response to bepirovirsen treatment. The Phase 2b clinical study findings reported here show that the large majority (92%) of non-responders, partial responders or relapsers did not have bepirovirsen binding site SNPs. Those with bepirovirsen binding site SNPs (7% of participants) still achieved HBsAg reductions, indicating that there is no need at this stage to test for specific HBV variants when administering bepirovirsen, and that treatment resistance via a change in sequence complementarity may be minimal and likely multifactorial. Additional data from ongoing Phase 3 studies of bepirovirsen will provide additional context for assessing this need, and for understanding potential mechanisms of resistance to bepirovirsen.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \n\n\nReviews&Editorials\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\npublisher website using the provided link\n\n\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\n    Editorial: Linking Patients With Cirrhosis to Clinical Care-The Hurdles and Way Forward.\n\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Editorial: TIPS in the Era of Aging and Metabolic Comorbidity: Rethinking Risks and Rewards.\n\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Review Article: Classic Bismuth Quadruple Therapy for Helicobacter pylori Infection-Questions Focused on Clinical Practice.\nBQT remains the most effective, safe, and practical regimen for H. pylori eradication, ensuring high cure rates across diverse resistance patterns and clinical settings.

Because systematic reviews were not performed, these Best Practice Advice statements do not carry formal ratings of the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx AGA Clinical Practice Update on the Role of Therapeutic Endoscopy in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Commentary.\nMethods This CPU was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute CPU committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership and underwent internal peer review by the CPU committee and external peer review through standard procedures of Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology. This communication incorporates important and recently published studies in the field, reflecting the experiences of the authors.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Gastrointest Endosc\n    ASGE consensus recommendations on the endoscopic management of eosinophilic esophagitis - part 2: disease assessment, monitoring, and pediatric considerations.\nStatements across al age ranges addressed the role of less-invasive monitoring, performing diagnostic endoscopy off treatment, the need to consider symptoms, endoscopic features, and histologic findings when assessing disease activity, treatment-based monitoring intervals, and the approach to esophageal biopsies during monitoring. Coupled with the original consensus work, we provide a comprehensive endoscopic approach to EoE as well as practical guidance for procedure-related aspects in the field to facilitate high-quality endoscopic care to patients with EoE.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \n\n\nMeta-analysis\nmeta-analyses and systematic reviews\n\n\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\n    Statin Therapy Independently Reduces Mortality and Liver Complications in Patients With Cirrhosis: An Updated Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.\nStatin therapy is associated with improved survival in cirrhosis, supported mechanistically by reductions in portal pressure. Observational evidence suggests benefits for decompensation and HCC, though these remain uncertain due to residual confounding. Large-scale, long-term RCTs are needed to clarify the role of statins as disease-modifying therapy in cirrhosis.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Am J Gastroenterol\n    Imaging Based Modalities for Identifying \"At Risk\" MASH. A Diagnostic Test Meta-analysis.\n FAST with its accessibility and robust diagnostic performance may be well-suited for large-scale application. MRI-based techniques are effective non-invasive options for diagnosing \"at risk\" MASH in MASLD and may provide strong alternatives. Rather than challenging existing perspectives, this study provides a reflective overview of current evidence on imaging-based modalities for \"at risk\" MASH.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx The Impact of Body Weight Change on Liver Histology in Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease Across Various Histological Endpoints: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.\n Even modest observed weight loss is associated with MASH resolution. MASH resolution and ≥1-stage fibrosis improvement are not impacted by BMI, T2DM or Hispanic/Latino ethnicity, reinforcing the importance of lifestyle interventions across populations. The proportions observed serve as benchmark estimates of histological response for future clinical trial design.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol\n    Impact of 20% Change in VCTE-measured Liver Stiffness on Liver-related Outcomes: A systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. \nThese findings highlight the potential of serial LSM measurements for monitoring chronic liver disease and for clinical trial endpoints. Prospective longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate if changes in LSM measurements over time are linked to improved patient outcomes.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \n\n\nOriginal articles\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\n\n\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\n    Characterisation and Prognostic Implication of Cholestasis After Burn Injury.\nCholestasis is frequent following burn injury. Prognosis is determined by bilirubin dynamics independently of disease and burn severity. Hyperbilirubinemia is associated with excess mortality ≥ 7 days after surviving burn injury.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Clinical Trial: Semaglutide Versus Placebo in NIT-Assessed MASH-A Multicenter Randomised Placebo-Controlled Trial (SAMARA).\nA NIT-based approach to identify at-risk MASH patients for semaglutide treatment is feasible and effective.

Randomized trials are needed to compare traditional MAP targets (60-65 mm Hg) with intermediate targets (70-75 mm Hg) to improve outcomes in this high-risk population.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Clinical Trial Endpoints for Perianal Fistulizing Crohn's Disease.\nBased on our evaluation, future trials should use co-primary clinical and radiologic assessments to capture both how the patient feels and an objective measure of disease activity. These findings reinforce the need for clearly defined, objective, and standardized endpoints for pCD clinical trials that will enable evaluation of novel therapies to improve patient outcomes.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Comparative Outcomes of Flexible Endoscopy, Rigid Endoscopy, and Open Surgery for Zenker's Diverticulum Repair: A Retrospective Matched Cohort Study.\n In this matched cohort, FE has clinical success comparable to OS and superior to RE for ZD repair, with shorter hospital stays, reduced procedure lengths, and a trend toward fewer adverse events. Our matched, multi-center design provides stronger comparative evidence than prior unmatched studies. These findings support FE as a first-line treatment for ZD repair, though prospective studies could further clarify long-term outcomes.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Postimaging Colorectal Cancer After Computed Tomography Colonography: A Danish Nationwide Study.\n We found a higher overall PICRC-3y-rate than previously reported. The overall PICRC-3y-rate was also higher than reported 3-year rates for postcolonoscopy CRCs.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Resection depth of underwater versus conventional endoscopic mucosal resection for intermediate-sized colorectal tumors.\n UEMR achieved a resection depth comparable to that of CEMR. Given its consistent negative horizontal margins, UEMR may become the gold standard for resecting intermediate-sized colorectal tumors.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx The Enterolimbic axis: gut-brain affective circuits at the crossroad of metabolism, emotion, and behavior.\nWe propose that gastroenterologists embrace these agents as first-line therapies, leveraging the unique endocrine role of the gut in metabolic regulation. This review integrates molecular, clinical, and therapeutic insights to outline diagnostic and precision-medicine opportunities arising from enterolimbic modulation.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx The Time-Dependent Association Between Irritable Bowel Syndrome and All-Cause and Cause-Specific Mortality in the NIH-AARP Cohort Study.\n We found time-dependent inverse associations between IBS and all-cause, cancer and cardiovascular disease mortality. Although this association seemed to be strongly confounded by personal health advocacy/healthcare access during very short follow-up, further research is needed to explore the factors contributing to these associations observed after longer follow-up.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx The Utility of MUC2 and CDX2 Expression in the Diagnosis of Barrett's Esophagus: A Community-based Study of Wide-Area Transepithelial Sampling and Forceps Biopsies.\nMUC2 immunohistochemistry may be more sensitive and specific for diagnosing BE than goblet cells by FB. FB misses approximately half of BE when using MUC2/WATS3D as an alternative gold standard. The addition of MUC2 immunohistochemistry may aid in the recognition of BE.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol\n    Serum IgG Response to a Conserved Domain of Commensal Flagellins Predicts Future Risk of Crohn's Disease in First-Degree Relatives. \nIncreased antibody response in healthy FDRs towards Lachnospiraceae flagellins is associated with future risk of CD. Importantly, pre-CD subjects shared seroreactivity towards a conserved bacterial flagellin epitope, which may represent an early pre-clinical biomarker of CD.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Endoscopy\n    Approaches to assessing completeness of polyp resections in clinical practice: a systematic scoping review. \nDifferent methods are available to assist in visual confirmation of complete resection and measuring IRRs, with considerable variability in their application. This review highlights the need for standardized assessment of complete colorectal polyp resection.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Universal submucosal dissection outperforms selective mucosal resection in early esophageal adenocarcinoma.\nESD achieved higher complete resection rates for both T1a and T1b cancers without increased morbidity. ESD may therefore represent the preferred strategy for early EAC, potentially reducing unnecessary surgery.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Gastroenterology\n    Endoscopic Ultrasound-Guided Choledochoduodenostomy vs Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography in Malignant Distal Biliary Obstruction to Prevent Postprocedural Pancreatitis: A Randomized Trial.\nEUS-CDS is superior to ERCP in reducing postprocedural acute pancreatitis risk. However, the overall risk of AEs was not significantly different and warrants further investigation. Additionally EUS-CDS showed improved technical success and comparable clinical efficacy. These results support a potential role of EUS-CDS as primary approach in selected patients with dilated common bile duct (ClinicalTrials.gov, Number  NCT04099862).\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Mutational Landscape of Colorectal Tumors From Individuals With Unexplained Adenomatous or Serrated Colorectal Polyposis.\nOur results indicate that BRAF-mutated serrated polyps are molecularly more similar to normal colon tissue than APC- and/or CTNNB1-mutated tumors. Overall, molecular tumor profiling of individuals with polyposis contributes to understanding the genetic disease etiology.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Gut\n    Complement-secreting CAFs are associated with better prognosis in pancreatic cancer: single-cell multiomics. \nPatients with a higher composition of csCAFs have significantly longer overall survival and recurrence-free survival through multiplex immunohistochemistry and bulk RNA-seq deconvolution. Our study demonstrates that csCAFs may represent an early-stage iCAF subtype and suggests a promising strategy for reprogramming iCAFs into csCAFs.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx KRAS mutation-driven O-GlcNAcylation of CLDN18.2 enhances the progression of pancreatic cancer and reduces the efficacy of CLDN18.2-targeted therapy.\nKRAS mutations and hyperglycaemia drive O-GlcNAcylation of CLDN18.2 at its C-terminal T204 site. O-GlcNAcylated CLDN18.2 promotes poor prognosis and reduces the effectiveness of CLDN18.2-targeted therapies. Low dose MRTX1133 restores CLDN18.2 membrane localisation by reducing its O-GlcNAcylation and augments CLDN18.2-targeted therapy efficacy, offering a novel combinatorial strategy for KRAS-mutant PDAC.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Zinc-dependent RNA-binding protein controls hepatocyte senescence and recovery from alcohol-related liver failure. \nManipulation of zinc availability altered ZFP36L1 activity and expression of its direct targets. These findings uncover a zinc-dependent ZFP36L1-regulon that governs hepatocyte fate by repressing p21- and JAG1-driven senescence and NOTCH activation and highlight ZFP36L1 as a promising therapeutic target in ALD.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Hepatology\n    Anatomic subsets of cholangiocarcinoma: More different than alike.\nEmerging strategies for early diagnosis and chemoprevention in high-risk populations further emphasize the significance of recognizing the unique biology of each subtype. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the distinct anatomic subsets of CCA, integrating their molecular and biological foundations with clinical management to inform practice and guide future research.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Biologically explicable multimodal model predicting local tumor progression and tumor invasiveness of hepatocellular carcinoma. \nThe 8 mm MAM ablation strategy can effectively decrease the LTP incidence of high-invasiveness group (from 42.4% to 10.5%, p=0.027) to the level comparable to low-invasiveness group (10.5% vs 6.1%, p=0.613) in external test set. Multimodal model achieved satisfactory performance on classifying tumor invasiveness, and provided effective strategy for high-invasiveness tumor to reduce LTP occurrence.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Biologically interpretable deep learning-derived MRI phenotypes reveal lymph node involvement and neoadjuvant therapy response in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.\n The SwinU-CliRad model can serve as a biologically interpretable tool for LN risk stratification in iCCA surgical candidates, with high-risk patients identified by the model potentially deriving benefit from NAT.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Clinical utilization of testing for cell-free DNA in hepatocellular cancer.\nIn contrast, the use of cfDNA for risk stratification, prognostication, and minimal residual disease detection remains in the early stages of clinical development. Future multicenter studies with standardized methodologies and rigorous validation will be essential to translate cfDNA into routine clinical practice for the management of HCC.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Liverrisk score (LRS) predicts long-term liver-related outcomes in a cohort of veterans without evidence of liver disease.\nLRS effectively predicted liver-related events, mortality, and HCC in Veterans. Its integration into clinical alerts and lab reports could support proactive patient care and liver disease prevention.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx NRF2-COX2-PGE2 axis drives immune cold tumors and predicts resistance to combination immunotherapy in hepatocellular carcinoma. \nTumor-intrinsic activation of the NRF2-COX2-PGE₂ axis drives immune cold TMEs and mediates Atez/Bev resistance in HCC.
