Advanced fibrosis is highly probable for LSM values ≥10 kPa. LSM values < 6 kPa almost totally exclude significant fibrosis. Between 6 and 10 kPa, liver biopsy should be discussed.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLong-term continuous terlipressin infusion improves cardiac reserve in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.\r\n Long-term continuous terlipressin infusion resulted in a significant increase in cardiac reserve and attenuation of the hyperdynamic state usually observed in decompensated cirrhosis. These data provide important mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis and reversibility of cardiac dysfunction in cirrhosis. Future studies are required to evaluate whether long-term terlipressin can prevent hepatic decompensating events such as hepatorenal syndrome in high-risk individuals. ANZCTR NUMBER  ( ACTRN12619000891123.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPerformance of AI-Enabled Electrocardiogram in the Prediction of Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease.\r\n This is a proof-of-concept study that an AI-based ECG model can detect MASLD with a comparable or superior performance as compared to the models using a single clinical parameter but not superior to the combination of clinical parameters. ECG can serve as another screening tool for MASLD in the non-hepatology space.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPredictors of functional cure of chronic hepatitis B virus infection - A long-term follow-up study.\r\nIn a cohort of chronic HBV-infected patients with long-term follow-up, HBeAg-seroconversion in childhood, high genetic barrier nucleos(t)ide analogue(s) therapy, and low HBsAg titers after HBeAg-seroconversion were significant predictors of functional cure.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRacial, Ethnic and Geographic Disparities in Digestive Diseases Mortality in the United States, 2000-2019.\r\nDespite an overall decrease in digestive diseases mortality, significant disparities persist across racial and ethnic groups.

We propose an EUS-first guided approach to post-AF ablation examination, followed by EGD if it is safe to do so.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopic Vacuum Therapy for Treatment of Boerhaave's syndrome: a multicenter analysis.\r\nEVT showed a high success rate for treatment of Boerhaave's syndrome and was associated with treatment success.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    MED12 loss activates endogenous retroelements to sensitise immunotherapy in pancreatic cancer.\r\n In summary, our findings underscore the pivotal role of MED12 in remodelling immnue TME through the epigenetic silencing of retrotransposons, offering a potential therapeutic target for enhancing tumour immunogenicity and overcoming immunotherapy resistance in PDAC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    Immunobiology of primary sclerosing cholangitis.\r\nThis review of the immunobiological landscape of PSC covers major immune cell types known to be enriched in PSC-diseased livers as well as recently described cell types whose biliary localization and contribution to PSC immunopathogenesis remain incompletely described. Finally, we emphasize the importance of time and space in relation to PSC heterogeneity as a key consideration for future studies interrogating the role of the immune system in PSC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLarge-scale hepatitis E virus genotype 3 outbreak on new caledonia island.\r\nAlthough al previous large-scale epidemics in Asia and Africa were associated with HEV-1 or 2, the New Caledonia outbreak was linked to HEV-3. A high number of symptomatic cases were admitted to hospital with a case fatality rate of 2.3%.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe rise of multidisciplinary clinics in hepatology: A practical, how-to-guide, and review of the literature.\r\nThis review provides practical advice in navigating the complex logistics of establishing and maintaining a hepatology MDC while also reviewing the emerging evidence on clinical outcomes for patients seen in these MDCs. As hepatology looks to the future, establishment of MDCs in key clinical areas will be the cornerstone of patient care.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    A machine learning model to predict liver-related outcomes after the functional cure of chronic hepatitis B.\r\n This novel machine learning model consisting of 7 variables provides reliable risk prediction of LRO after HBsAg seroclearance that can be used for personalized surveillance.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAssociation of Food Insecurity with the Prevalence and Liver-related Mortality of Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD).\r\nAnd Relevance  MASLD prevalence and LRM exhibit significant geographical variability across the globe which can be influenced by clinic-demographic, and food insecurity. Targeted public health strategies which considers socio-economic realities of each region are essential for mitigating the global burden of MASLD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDysglycemia and liver lipid content determine the relationship of insulin resistance with hepatic OXPHOS capacity in obesity.\r\nRising liver lipid contents and plasma glucose concentrations, even in the non-diabetic range, are associated with a progressive decline of hepatic mitochondrial adaptation in people with obesity and insulin resistance. CLINTRIALS. Gov identifier NCT01477957.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFrailty and risk of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and other chronic liver diseases.\r\nFrailty was associated with an increased risk of chronic liver diseases. Public health strategies should target reducing chronic liver disease risk in frail individuals. Impact and implications While frailty is common and associated with a poor prognosis in people with MASLD and advanced chronic liver diseases, its impact on the subsequent risk of these outcomes remains largely unexplored. Our study showed that frailty was associated with the increased risks of MASLD, cirrhosis, liver cancer, and liver-related mortality. This finding suggests that assessing frailty may help identify a high-risk population vulnerable to developing chronic liver diseases. Implementing strategies that target frailty could have major public health benefits for liver-related disease prevention.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIdentification and functional validation of miR-190b-5p and miR-296-3p as novel therapeutic attenuators of liver fibrosis.\r\nCollectively, in our study we discovered miR-190b-5p and miR-296-3p as two novel anti-fibrotic miRNAs, and that HAS2 and ITGA6 contribute to miR-190b-5p- and miR-296-3p-mediated inhibition of liver fibrosis. These results provide a foundation for future research to explore the clinical utility of miR-190b-5p and miR-296-3p in liver injuries with fibrosis. Impact and implications Liver fibrosis and cirrhosis contribute to millions of deaths world-wide and, till date, remain as unmet medical needs. In this study, we discovered two microRNAs, miR-190b-5p and miR-296-3p, which suppress liver fibrosis in preclinical mouse models and a human liver bud model. Our promising results encourage further studies that aim to develop both miRNAs for the treatment of liver fibrosis in patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSequential Peg-IFN after bepirovirsen may reduce post-treatment relapse in chronic hepatitis B.\r\nSequential therapy with bepirovirsen followed by Peg-IFN is tolerable and effective in participants with chronic HBV infection on stable NA.

However, ACT offers a significant added benefit for HRQoL and self-reported Crohn's disease activity and may be a useful adjuvant therapy in integrated IBD care.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClinical Characteristics, Endoscopic Findings, and Treatment Outcomes in Lymphocytic Esophagitis Compared to Eosinophilic Esophagitis.\r\n LyE is clinically different from EoE, but differences in treatment response need further investigation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClinical and biological perspectives on non-canonical esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in rare subtypes.\r\nMoreover, we leverage the convergence of these diseases on ESCC to identify common mechanisms underlying malignant transformation including aberrant proliferation, mucosal barrier dysfunction, increased inflammation, and genome instability. Herein, we summarize the clinical presentation, pathologic findings, potential screening strategies, and common mechanisms of malignant transformation associated with these rare diseases that drive ESCC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClinical implications of inflammation in patients with cirrhosis.\r\nThose patients with the most profound systemic inflammation have the worst prognosis. Systemic inflammation exerts its negative clinical effects via a number of mechanisms including nitric oxide-mediated increased splanchnic vasodilation, immunopathology and metabolic reallocation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFECAL IMMUNOCHEMICAL TEST TO DETECT COLORECTAL NEOPLASIA IN LYNCH SYNDROME - A PROSPECTIVE MULTICENTER STUDY.\r\nFIT at thresholds ≤ 4.1 μg Hb/g feces may be a promising strategy to postpone colonoscopy in approximately 9 out of 10 individuals with Lynch syndrome. Large validation studies that also provide gene variant-specific outcomes should be prioritized.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFecal Proteolytic Bacteria and Staphylococcal Superantigens are Associated with Abdominal Pain Severity in Irritable Bowel Syndrome.\r\n In keeping with our preclinical findings, we show that increased presence of SAg-producing S. aureus in fecal samples of patients with IBS is associated with increased levels of abdominal pain. We also show that increased fecal proteolytic activity is associated with increased abdominal pain in patients with IBS.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGranulocyte colony stimulating factor improves Prednisolone responsiveness and 90-day survival in steroid eligible severe Alcohol associated Hepatitis: The GPreAH Study a randomized trial.\r\n Addition of GCSF to prednisolone improves steroid responsiveness and 90-day survival with fewer infections and new onset complications in SAH patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInternet delivered exposure based cognitive behavior therapy for IBS - A clinical effectiveness study.\r\nWe conclude that ECBT is effective under real world conditions, also when delivered via the internet, and that an important treatment mechanism is the reduction of avoidance behaviors.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOptimizing Cost-Effective Care for Chronic Constipation in General Gastroenterology Using an Office-Based, Point-Of-Care Test (RED): Cost-Effectiveness and Cost-Minimization Analysis.\r\n Point-of-care testing using RED appears cost-effective/cost-saving to triage chronic constipation care in general gastroenterology.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOral breathing facilitates endoscopic operability compared to nasal breathing in peroral endoscopy: a randomized controlled trial.\r\nOB facilitates endoscopic operability compared to NB in peroral endoscopy. UE with OB is recommended as the preferred choice for unsedated peroral endoscopy in daily practice.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS CONTRIBUTE TO REAL-TIME ESOPHAGEAL SYMPTOM REPORTING IN REFRACTORY REFLUX PATIENTS.\r\nInterpretation Real-time reflux symptom reporting is a multifactorial process, with both psychological and physiological processes contributing to different aspects of the reflux disease experience. Findings build on questionnaire-based research to underscore the importance of including psychological processes in our understanding of esophageal symptom reporting.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSevere Polypharmacy Increases Risk of Hospitalization Among Older Adults with IBD.\r\n Severe polypharmacy was initially present in more than 25% of older adults with IBD and increased to 34% within 4 years of index visit. Severe polypharmacy, as well as PIM utilization among those with polypharmacy, were also associated with an increased risk of hospitalization at one-year, highlighting the need for deprescribing efforts in this population.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSpine and sacroiliac joint involvement in newly diagnosed inflammatory bowel disease patients - clinical and magnetic resonance imaging findings from a population-based cohort.\r\n One-in-six newly diagnosed IBD patients had MRI findings indicative of axSpA. As 40% of these patients were asymptomatic, this suggests that axSpA is underdiagnosed in early IBD. Multidisciplinary collaboration is essential to ensure early detection of axial inflammation and to enable optimal therapy preventing future structural damage and disability.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Causal Effect of Intra-Pancreatic Fat Deposition on Acute and Chronic Pancreatitis: A Mendelian Randomization Study.\r\n Our findings support a causal role of IPFD in pancreatitis, suggesting that reducing IPFD could lower the risk of pancreatitis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTiming of Direct Oral Anticoagulants Resumption Following Colorectal Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection: A Nationwide Study in Japan.\r\nResuming DOACs the day after colorectal ESD was associated with reduced thromboembolic events without significant increase in risk of delayed bleeding.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Ancestral diversity in pharmacogenomics affects treatment for Hispanic/Latine populations with inflammatory bowel disease.\r\n These findings indicate that NUDT15 testing should become standard clinical practice before prescribing thiopurines in individuals with Amerindian ancestry, including Hispanic individuals. Additionally, rs2097432 should not be used as a surrogate for HLA-DQA1*05 testing for diverse populations. Ultimately, incorporating ancestry in personalized therapeutic approaches is important for treatment of Hispanic patients with IBD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nBaseline viral load and on-treatment hepatocellular carcinoma risk in chronic hepatitis B: A multinational cohort study.\r\n Baseline viral load showed a significant, non-linear, parabolic association with HCC risk during antiviral treatment in noncirrhotic CHB patients. Early initiation of antiviral treatment based on HBV viral load may help prevent irreversible HCC risk accumulation in CHB patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDecreasing Case Fatality Rates for Patients with Cirrhosis Infected with SARS-CoV-2: A National COVID Cohort Collaborative Study.\r\nIn this N3C study, we found that the observed 30-day CFR decreased progressively for both CLD patients with and without cirrhosis, consistent with broader trends seen in the general population.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEffects of intermittent calorie restriction in non-diabetic patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.\r\nThe ICR diet reduced LFC more effectively than SOC in patients with MASLD, particularly in patients with obesity. Additional studies are warranted in larger and more diverse cohorts.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEmergency Department Utilization and Outcomes among Adults with Cirrhosis from 2008 to 2022 in the United States.\r\nPatients with cirrhosis have higher ED utilization and almost 2-fold higher post-ED visit mortality than CHF and COPD. These findings provide impetus for ED-based interventions to improve cirrhosis-related outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIL-1 Signal Inhibition in Alcohol-Related Hepatitis: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of canakinumab.\r\n CAN therapy in severe AH participants with MELD≤27 did not alter biochemical or clinical outcomes compared to PBO. Non-significant histological improvements did not translate into clinical benefit.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPersistence of Lugol-unstaining is associated with an increased risk of progression to malignancy in the esophagus.\r\n The persistence of LULs is associated with progression to malignancy in the esophagus, even in individuals without dysplastic lesions. Based on this, a more efficient post-screening surveillance strategy could be established.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPrevalence and incidence of hepatitis E infection in China.\r\nOur findings would help inform policy making for hepatitis E prevention and control in China, as well as in other endemic regions of the world.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRole of early on-treatment serum HBV RNA declines in predicting hepatocellular carcinoma risk in patients with chronic hepatitis B.\r\nSerum HBV RNA declines at year 1 and 2 were significantly associated with on-treatment HCC risk. Incorporating early on-treatment HBV RNA declines into HCC risk prediction models can be useful tools to guide appropriate surveillance strategies in NA-treated patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTravel Time to Treating Center is Associated with Diagnostic Delay in Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\nConsistent with prior literature, diagnostic delay is longer for CD than UC. Reassuringly, time to diagnosis is equitable across racioethnic groups. New models of diagnostic care are needed for communities affected by longer travel times.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndosc Int Open\r\n    Direct endoscopic necrosectomy: Pilot study of a new dedicated device.\r\nDEN with Necrolit appears feasible and safe.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nEfficacy and safety of a single-use cholangioscope for percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy.\r\n(ClinicalTrials. gov number, NCT04580940).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nEndoscopic ultrasound with tissue acquisition of lymph nodes in patients with potentially resectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.\r\nIn patients with potentially resectable iCCA and suspicious LNs on cross-sectional imaging, EUS-TA confirmed LN involvement in 30% of patients. Surgical exploration was withheld mostly because of extraregional LN involvement and regional LN involvement in patients with high surgical risk.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nOutcome after colorectal full-thickness resection and management of recurrence.\r\nFor non-lifting adenomas and early carcinomas, close follow-up is mandatory to detect late recurrence. Long-term outcomes after hybrid eFTR need further investigation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nEndoscopy\r\n    Can optical evaluation distinguish between t1a and t1b esophageal adenocarcinoma: an international expert inter-observer agreement study.\r\nExpert Barrett's endoscopists can reliably differentiate T1a/T1b oesophageal adenocarcinoma from HGD. Although there is fair-to-moderate agreement for T-staging, T1b disease cannot be reliably distinguished from T1a disease. This may have implications on clinical decision making and selection of endoscopic treatment methods.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Crohn's patients and healthy infants share immunodominant B cell response to commensal flagellin peptide epitopes.\r\nThese findings identified a distinct subset of CD patients, united by a shared reactivity to a dominant commensal bacterial flagellin epitope that may represent failure of a homeostatic response to the gut microbiota beginning in infancy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nExon Skipping-based Subtyping of Colorectal Cancers.\r\nHere we demonstrate that a small number of ES events can reliably classify colorectal cancer subtypes using individual patient specimen in a manner suitable to clinical application.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGlutamine supplementation as a novel metabolic therapeutic strategy for LIG3-dependent chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction.\r\nLIG3 deficiency leads to mitochondrial dysfunction. High levels L-Gln supplementation was beneficial in LIG3-mutant cells and improved symptom severity without noticeable side effects. Our results provide a proof-of-concept to design ad hoc clinical trials with L-Gln in LIG3-mutant patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRecompensation of Chronic Hepatitis C-related decompensated cirrhosis following direct-acting antiviral therapy: Prospective Cohort study from an HCV elimination program.\r\nSVR-12 in HCV-related decompensated cirrhosis in a predominant genotype 3 population, led to recompensation in 24.7% of patients over a follow-up of 4 years in a public health setting.

Our data supports VKORC1 as a bona fide MASLD gene. We have established a functional genomic framework to study at scale putative novel MASLD genes from human genetic association studies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCholangiocyte ciliary defects induce sustained epidermal growth factor receptor signaling.\r\n This study's findings shed light on ciliary function and robust EGFR signaling with slower receptor turnover. We could use therapies that restore the function of primary cilia to treat EGFR-driven diseases in PLD and CCA.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHuman induced pluripotent stem cell based hepatic-modeling of lipid metabolism associated TM6SF2 E167K variant.\r\nOur findings indicate that induced hepatocytes generated from iPSCs carrying the TM6SF2-E167K recapitulate the effects observed in human hepatocytes from individuals with the TM6SF2 mutation. This study characterizes an in vitro model that can be used as a platform to identify potential clinical targets and highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting protein misfolding to alleviate ER stress and mitigate the detrimental effects of the TM6SF2-E167K mutation on hepatic lipid metabolism.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIncidence of liver complications with hemochromatosis associated HFE p.C282Y homozygosity: The role of central adiposity.\r\n In p.C282Y+/+ males and females, increasing WHR is associated with substantially higher risks of liver complications. Interventions to reduce central adiposity to improve these outcomes should be tested.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIntegrative single-cell and spatial transcriptomic analyses identify a pathogenic cholangiocyte niche and TNFRSF12A as therapeutic target for biliary atresia.\r\nPathogenic cholangiocytes enriched niche identifies TNFRSF12A as a potential therapeutic target for BA.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMdka produced by the activated HSCs drives bipotential progenitor cell redifferentiation during zebrafish biliary-mediated liver regeneration.\r\nThe activated HSCs produce Mdka to drive the redifferentiation process of BP-PCs through activating Erk1 during the biliary-mediated liver regeneration, implying previously unappreciated contributions of nonparenchymal cells to this regeneration process.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOptimizing thiopurine therapy in autoimmune hepatitis: A multi-center study on monitoring metabolite profiles and co-therapy with allopurinol.\r\nMaintaining CBR in AIH was associated with 6TGN ≥223 pmol/0.2 ml. For patients who fail to achieve CBR and therapeutic 6TGN levels despite thiopurine dose increase due to preferential 6MMP formation, co-medication of allopurinol alongside low-dose thiopurines represents an efficient alternative.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    ACMSD inhibition corrects fibrosis, inflammation, and DNA damage in MASLD/MASH.\r\nOur findings highlight the benefits of ACMSD inhibition to enhance hepatic NAD + levels and enable genomic protection, underscoring its therapeutic potential in MASLD/MASH. Impact and implications Enhancing NAD + levels has shown remarkable health benefits in mouse models of MASLD/MASH, yet liver-specific NAD + boosting strategies remain underexplored. Here, we present a novel pharmacological approach to enhance liver NAD + de novo synthesis by inhibiting ACMSD, an enzyme highly expressed in the liver. Inhibiting ACMSD increases NAD + levels, enhances mitochondrial respiration, and maintains genomic stability in hepatocytes ex vivo and in vivo. These molecular benefits prevent disease progression in both mouse and human liver organoid models of steatohepatitis. Our preclinical study identifies ACMSD as a promising target for MASLD/MASH management and lays the groundwork for developing ACMSD inhibitors as a clinical treatment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIdentifying the optimal measurement timing and hemodynamic targets of portal pressure gradient after TIPS in patients with cirrhosis and variceal bleeding: a prospective cohort study.\r\nPPG measured 24 to 72 hours after TIPS correlates with long term PPG and clinical outcomes, and hemodynamic target with a PPG 11-14 mmHg reduced encephalopathy but not compromised clinical efficacy. Impact and implications The optimal timing of measurement and hemodynamic targets of portacaval pressure gradient (PPG) after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) remains inconclusive. Here we show that post-TIPS PPG measured at least 24 hours but not immediately after the procedure correlated with long-term PPG and clinical events, therefore should be used for decision making in order to improve clinical outcomes. Targeting post-TIPS PPG at 11-14 mmHg or 20%-50% relative reduction from pre-TIPS baseline that measured 24-72 hours after procedure reduced encephalopathy but not compromised clinical efficacy, therefore could be used to guide TIPS creation and revision in patients with cirrhosis and variceal bleeding undergoing covered TIPS. Clinical trial registration\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPorto-sinusoidal vascular liver disorder with portal hypertension: Natural History and Long-Term Outcome.\r\nPrognosis of PSVD is strongly determined by the severity of the associated underlying conditions and parameters of liver and renal function.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTargeting the liver clock improves fibrosis by restoring TGF-β signaling.\r\n The CC regulates TGF-β signaling, and the breakdown of this control is associated with liver fibrosis in patients. Pharmacological proof-of-concept studies across different models uncover the CC as a therapeutic candidate target for liver fibrosis - a rising global unmet medical need. Impact and implications Liver fibrosis due to metabolic diseases is a global health challenge. Many liver functions are rhythmic throughout the day being controlled by the circadian clock (CC). Here we demonstrate that the regulation of the CC is perturbed upon chronic liver injury and this perturbation contributes to fibrotic disease. By showing that a compound targeting the CC improves liver fibrosis in patient-derived models, this study provides a novel therapeutic candidate strategy to treat fibrosis in patients. Additional studies will be needed for clinical translation. Since the findings uncovers a previously undiscovered profibrotic mechanism and therapeutic target, the study is of interest for scientists investigating liver disease, clinical hepatologists and drug developers.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThyroid hormone receptor-beta agonist HSK31679 alleviates MASLD by modulating gut microbial sphingolipids.\r\nThis study provided novel insights into the indispensable gut microbiota for HSK31679 treatment, which revealed microbial GCS may serve as its prognostic biomarker of MASH treatment, as well as the new target for further strategies of microbiota-based MASH therapeutics. Impact and implications Remarkable heterogeneity of individual clinical efficacy of THR-β agonists and their interferences with microbiome in host hepatoenteral circulation are poorly understood. In our current germ-free mice models and randomized, double-blind multiple-dose cohort study, we identified microbial GCS as the prognostic biomarker of HSK31679 treatment, as well as the new target for further strategies of microbiota-based MASLD therapeutics.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nVariation in intention-to-treat survival by MELD subtypes: all models created for end-stage liver disease are not equal.\r\nFor equivalent listing practices, registrants with MELD-Cr subtype have lower ITT survival. MELD subtype may serve as a more sophisticated variable for dynamic assessment of risk of mortality, to inform models for organ allocation. Impact and implications The MELD score is an excellent predictor of waitlist mortality;  however, our work highlights that the driver of a patient's score MELD score matters and particularly those driven by elevated creatinine have a lower 1-year ITT mortality. The 1-year ITT mortality is also lower for women compared to men within the Cr-dominant subtype. These results are important for physicians and patients undergoing LT evaluation as creatinine may serve as a marker of prognosis and even if the creatinine improves the prognosis remains poor, necessitating discussion about alternative pathways for transplant. Our work also highlights that the type of kidney injury matters, in that those AKI were more likely to die or remain on the waitlist compared to those with CKD within the creatinine dominant subtype.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Review article: Evidence-based dietary management of inflammatory bowel disease.\r\nFour pillars of nutritional management require specific assessment and interventional strategies that should be chosen by evidence.

These results support the benefits of STRIDE for participants with uHCC globally, including the Asia-Pacific region. Clinical trial number NCT03298451 IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS  The global, phase III HIMALAYA study found that the STRIDE (Single Tremelimumab Regular Interval Durvalumab) regimen improved overall survival (OS), including long-term OS, vs sorafenib, and that durvalumab monotherapy was noninferior to sorafenib in participants with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC). However, there are differences in the aetiology and clinical practices related to HCC in parts of Asia, compared to Western countries and Japan, which could lead to differences in treatment outcomes between these regions. The results of this analysis demonstrate the benefits of STRIDE for participants in the Asia-Pacific region, consistent with the full, global study population. Overall, these findings continue to support the use of STRIDE in a diverse population, reflective of uHCC globally.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPegIFN alpha-2a reduces relapse in HBeAg-negative patients after nucleo(s)tide analogue cessation: A randomized-controlled trial.\r\nSwitching from NUC to PegIFN-α-2a treatment for 48 weeks significantly reduces virological relapse rates and achieves higher HBsAg loss rates than NUC treatment cessation alone in HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B patients. Impact and implications Nucleo(s)tide analogue (NUC) cessation can lead to HBsAg clearance but also a high rate of virological relapse, but an optimised scheme to reduce the virological relapse rate after NUC withdrawal is yet to be reported. This randomized controlled trial investigated the effect of switching from NUC to PegIFN-α-2a treatment for 48 weeks on virological relapse until week 96 in HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B patients. The interferon monotherapy group had a significantly lower cumulative virological relapse rate (20.8% vs 53.6%, P < 0.0001) and higher HBsAg loss rate (21.5% vs 9.0%, P= 0.03) than the NUC cessation group until week 96. This provides an optimized strategy for NUC cessation in HBeAg-negative patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTransposon-based oncogene integration in Abcb4(Mdr2)-/- mice recapitulates high susceptibility to cholangiocarcinoma in primary sclerosing cholangitis.\r\nMdr2-/-, which features reliable tumor induction in PSC-like background of biliary injury and fibrosis.
