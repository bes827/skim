Clinical trial number;  ClinicalTrials.gov identifier  NCT05296733. Impact and implications Survodutide is a glucagon receptor/glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor dual agonist in development for treatment of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), which causes cirrhosis in ∼20% of cases. This trial delineates the pharmacokinetic and safety profile of survodutide in people with compensated or decompensated cirrhosis, and revealed associated reductions in liver fat content, markers of liver fibrosis and body weight. These findings have potential relevance for people with MASH-including those with decompensated cirrhosis, who are usually excluded from clinical trials of investigational drugs. Based on this study, further investigation of survodutide for MASH-related cirrhosis is warranted.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Editorial: Mucosal healing with steroids: Once upon a time in ulcerative colitis.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Sonographic assessment of colonic content: A new tool for constipation?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReview article: Hepatic steatosis and its associations with acute and chronic liver diseases.\r\nDiverse liver pathologies are associated with hepatic steatosis, with MASLD being the most important contributor.

When accounting for increased injection drug use, estimated prevalence of hepatitis C is substantially higher than previously reported. National action is urgently needed to expand testing, increase access to treatment, and improve surveillance, especially among medically underserved populations, to support hepatitis C elimination goals.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIdentifying a therapeutic window of opportunity for people living with primary sclerosing cholangitis: Embryology and the overlap of inflammatory bowel disease with immune mediated liver injury.\r\nThis is critical for the optimal targeting of studies into PSC etiopathogenesis and emphasizes the concept of a \"developmental window of opportunity for therapeutic mitigation\" in what is currently recognized as an irreversible disease process. The discovery of such a window would be critically important for the targeting of interventions, both administration of current therapies and therapeutic trial planning.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMASLD/MetALD and mortality in individuals with any cardio-metabolic risk factor: a population based study with 26.7 years of follow-up.\r\n In individuals with CMRF, the presence of steatotic liver disease (MASLD) alone did not increase the risk of mortality, except in cases with more alcohol consumption (MetALD). Therefore controlling metabolic risk factors and reducing alcohol consumption in people with MASLD or MetALD will be crucial steps to improve long-term health outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTargeting cellular cathepsins inhibits hepatitis E virus entry.\r\nIn summary, our study highlights the pivotal role of lysosomal cathepsins, especially CTSL, in the HEV entry process. The profound anti-HEV efficacy of the pan-cathepsin inhibitor, K11777, especially with its notable safety profile in primary cells, further underscores its potential as a therapeutic candidate.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Bulevirtide monotherapy in patients with chronic HDV: Efficacy and safety results through week 96 from a phase 3 randomized trial.\r\nVirologic and biochemical responses were maintained and/or increased with longer-term BLV therapy, including in those with suboptimal early virologic response. BLV monotherapy for CHD was safe and well tolerated through W96. Impact and implications In July 2023, bulevirtide was fully approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis delta (CHD) in Europe based on clinical study results from up to 48 weeks of treatment. Understanding the efficacy and safety of bulevirtide over the longer term is important for healthcare providers. In this analysis, we demonstrate that bulevirtide monotherapy for 96 weeks in patients with CHD was associated with continued improvements in combined, virologic, and biochemical responses as well as liver stiffness from week 48 at both the 2-mg and 10-mg doses. Patients with suboptimal virologic responses to bulevirtide at week 24 also benefited from continued therapy, with the majority achieving virologic response or biochemical improvement by week 96.

Following comprehensive in vitro and clinical data analysis together with input from the expert committee, an evidence-based consensus-driven list of 10 positive and negative drugs is proposed for validating in vitro models for improving preclinical drug safety testing regimes. Impact and implications Prediction of human toxicity early in the drug development process remains a major challenge. For this, human in vitro models are becoming increasingly important, however, the development of more physiologically relevant liver models and careful selection of control DILI+ and DILI- drugs are requisites to better predict DILI liability of new drug candidates. Thus, this systematic study holds critical implications for standardizing validation of new in vitro models for studying drug-induced liver injury (DILI). By establishing a consensus-driven list of positive and negative control drugs, the study provides a scientifically justified framework for enhancing the consistency of preclinical testing, thereby addressing a significant challenge in early hepatotoxicity identification. The results are of paramount importance to al the actors involved in the drug development process, offering a standardized approach to assess hepatotoxic risks. Practically, these findings can guide researchers in evaluating safety profiles of new drugs, refining in vitro models, and informing regulatory agencies on potential improvements to regulatory guidelines, ensuring a more systematic and efficient approach to drug safety assessment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Outcomes of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma treated with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab in real-world clinical practice who met or did not meet the inclusion criteria for the phase 3 IMbrave150 trial.\r\nPatients who are treated with Atezo/Bev and meet the inclusion criteria for the phase 3 IMbrave150 trial, as well as those who do not meet the inclusion criteria but have good liver function, have a good prognosis for survival.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReal-life effectiveness of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir in hepatitis C patients previously treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or glecaprevir/pibrentasvir.\r\n SOF/VEL/VOX is an effective rescue therapy for failures to SOF/VEL or GLE/PIB, with an SVR of 88.6%. Factors previously linked to lower SVR rates, such as GT3 infection, cirrhosis and first-line therapy with SOF/VEL were not associated with lower SVRs.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe deep abdominal ultrasound transducer (DAX) increases the success rate and diagnostic accuracy of shear wave elastography for liver fibrosis assessment in patients with obesity-A prospective biopsy-controlled study.\r\npSWE- and 2D-SWE enable the non-invasive identification of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in patients with obese MASLD. The use of the DAX transducer for acoustic radiation force imaging (ARFI)-LSM avoids technical failures in an obese population and subsequently offers advantages over VCTE-LSM for the evaluation of fibrosis in an obese MASLD population at risk for fibrosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe use of opioids nine months after surgery for Crohn's disease - a nationwide cohort study.\r\n Clinicians should be aware that in patients with a need for opioids before surgery, the surgery may not change the need for opioids.

In Barrett's cells, ABS trigger EMP via HIF-1α signalling. Thus, HIF-1α appears to play a key role in mediating reflux-induced EMP that might contribute to cancer in BO.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImpact of age, comorbidities and relevant changes on surveillance strategy of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms: a competing risk analysis.\r\n Although it is not uncommon the occurrence of changes considered by current guidelines as relevant during surveillance of low risk BD-IPMNs, malignancy rate is low and survival is significantly affected by competing patients' age and comorbidities. IPMN surveillance strategy should be tailored based on these features and modulated over time.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    A genome-wide association study identified PTPN2 as a population-specific susceptibility gene locus for primary biliary cholangitis.\r\nPTPN2, a novel susceptibility gene for PBC in the Japanese population, may be involved in the pathogenesis of PBC via an insufficient negative feedback loop caused by the PTPN2 risk allele of rs2292758 in IFN signaling. This suggests that PTPN2 could be a potential molecular target for PBC treatment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAlcohol-associated liver disease - global epidemiology.\r\nAddressing the growing ALD concern requires robust public health initiatives, heightened awareness, refined diagnostic techniques, and comprehensive epidemiological studies. These measures are vital to tackle the increasing prevalence of ALD and mitigate its extensive impact on individuals and healthcare systems.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJFH1-based Core-NS2 genotype variants of HCV with genetic stability in vivo and in vitro: Important tools in evaluation of virus neutralization.\r\nThese mouse-selected HCV recombinants enable triage of new vaccine-relevant antibodies in vitro and further allow characterization of protection from infection in vivo using identical viruses in human-liver chimeric mice. As such, these viruses will serve as important resources in testing novel antibodies and can thus guide strategies to develop an efficient protective vaccine against HCV infection.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPNPLA3 rs738409, age, diabetes, sex, and advanced fibrosis jointly contribute to the risk of major adverse liver outcomes in metabolic-associated steatotic liver disease.\r\nThe deleterious effects of PNPLA3 rs738409 on the risk of MALO are significantly worsened by advanced fibrosis, age, T2DM, and sex.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nVascular damage and excessive proliferation compromise liver function after extended hepatectomy in mice.\r\nIn summary, SFSS arises from an imbalance and desynchronized interplay between functional regeneration and vascular restructuring. To improve survival following SFSS-hepatectomy, it is essential to adopt a two-pronged strategy aimed at preserving the function of proliferating parenchymal cells and simultaneously attenuating vascular damage.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Comparison of non-contrast abbreviated MRI and ultrasound as surveillance modalities for HCC.\r\nAnnual NC-AMRI showed a marginally higher sensitivity than biannual US for HCC detection in high-risk patients. The DY of annual NC-AMRI was significantly higher than that of biannual US, without increasing the FRR. Alternating US and NC-AMRI at 6-month intervals could be an optimal surveillance strategy for high-risk patients. Impact and implications Current guidelines permit the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a surveillance tool for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients in whom ultrasonography (US) is inadequate. However, the specific indications, imaging sequences, and surveillance intervals for MRI surveillance remain unclear. In our study, we found that annual non-contrast (NC)-abbreviated MRI (AMRI) exhibited marginally higher sensitivity and significantly better diagnostic yield than biannual US in high-risk patients for HCC. Adopting alternating US and NC-AMRI at 6-month intervals demonstrated significantly improved sensitivity compared to biannual US, making it a potentially optimal surveillance strategy for high-risk patients.
