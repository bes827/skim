Bilateral LSMS placement is a viable option for MHBO patients with advantages of less operative difficulty and easier future re-intervention over conventional SBS stenting.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSURVEILLANCE FINDINGS IN HIGH-RISK PATIENTS AFTER BASELINE COMPUTER-ASSISTED DETECTION COLONOSCOPY: A PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING ANALYSIS.\r\nPatients who had CADe use at baseline colonoscopy had significantly lower rates of metachronous lesions, including advanced adenoma, on surveillance colonoscopy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSafety and efficacy of endoscopic ultrasound-guided pelvic abscess drainage with lumen-apposing metal stents for complicated acute diverticulitis. \r\nEUS-PAD could be considered a safe and effective rescue strategy in case of failed or contraindicated percutaneous approach for the management of complicated AD to reduce the need for urgent surgery. Comparative data is necessary to confirm these observations.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThirty-day hospital admission following high-risk outpatient ERCP: incidence and analysis of risk factors based on a secondary analysis of the Stent Versus Indomethacin trial dataset.\r\nHigh-risk patients who undergo outpatient ERCP and are discharged home are at considerable risk for hospital admission within 30 days and have increased rate of pancreatitis and longer length of hospital stay compared to outpatients admitted to the hospital immediately following ERCP, and some factors may predict this outcome. These findings should influence decision making and informed consent when electing to proceed with high-risk ERCP, recognizing that patients with sphincter of Oddi dysfunction were over-represented in this cohort, which may limit generalizability to a typical ERCP practice.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    Aptamer-directed, nanovesicle-mediated targeting of undruggable molecules in preclinical cholangiocarcinoma models.\r\nHerein, we show that aptamer-directed, nanovesicle-mediated targeting of YAP, LCK, and tafazzin potentiates chemosensitivity in two CCA models when delivered using aptamer-guided milk-derived nanovesicles.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGlobal burden of HBV-related liver disease: Primary liver cancer due to chronic HBV infection increased in over one-third of countries globally from 2000 to 2021. \r\nFrom 2000 to 2021, decreases in HBV-related liver disease incidence and prevalence were observed;  however, more than one-third of countries showed an increase in the incidence of HBV-related PLC. These findings highlight the need for strengthened HBV treatment efforts to reduce the risk of liver cancer.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTargeting protein hyperSUMOylation halts cholangiocarcinoma progression by impairing cancer cell viability and tumor-stroma crosstalk.\r\n Aberrant SUMOylation drives CCA progression by enhancing cell survival, proliferation, and shaping the tumor microenvironment. Targeting SUMOylation shows potential in inhibiting CCA growth, representing a promising therapeutic strategy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    A phase IIb randomised-controlled trial of the FFAR1/FFAR4 agonist icosabutate in MASH. \r\nAlthough the primary endpoint was not met, treatment with icosabutate demonstrated encouraging fibrosis (as measured by both conventional and AI-assisted digital pathology) and non-invasive biomarker data, supporting further development in MASH patients. NCT04052516 IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: • With expression on multiple cells types regulating both glycemic control and liver inflammation, targeting free fatty acid receptors 1 and 4 could offer an attractive approach for the treatment of both fibrosing MASH and it's comorbidities.• Although treatment of F1-F3 MASH patients with oral icosabutate (a FFAR1/FFAR4 agonist) did not meet the pre-defined primary endpoint (MASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis), the overall dataset (including AI-assisted digital pathology) suggest an improvement in fibrosis in treated patients.• Improvements in multiple biomarkers of liver damage, inflammation and glycemic control were observed in response to therapy.• Icosabutate was generally safe and well-tolerated, and the overall data support further testing of icosabutate in MASH patients, in particular those with more advanced disease (F2-F3 fibrosis) and type 2 diabetes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHyodeoxycholic acid ameliorates cholestatic liver fibrosis by facilitating m<sup>6<\/sup>A-regulated expression of a novel anti-fibrotic target ETV4.\r\nThe present study underscores ETV4 as a novel anti-fibrotic target and demonstrates that HDCA remodels ECM by facilitating m 6 A-regulated ETV4 expression, offering potential therapeutic approaches for cholestatic liver fibrosis. Impact and implications This study delves into the underlying mechanisms of cholestatic liver fibrosis and offers potential therapeutic targets. The research highlights ETV4 as a novel anti-fibrotic target and is essential for the therapeutic effects of hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA) against cholestatic liver fibrosis. These findings are important for both the scientific community and patients with cholestatic liver diseases, offering valuable insights for future therapeutic strategies that focus on regulating m 6 A-dependent epigenetic modifications of anti-fibrotic targets like ETV4 and developing new interventions utilizing HDCA.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNumber of people treated for hepatitis C virus infection in 2014-2023 and applicable lessons for new HBV and HDV therapies.\r\nIn the last 10 years, 21% of al HCV infections were treated with DAAs. Regional and temporal variations highlight the importance of active screening strategies. Without program enhancements, the number of treated PLHCV stalled in every country/region which may not reflect a lower prevalence but may instead reflect the diminishing returns of the existing strategies. Impact and implications Long-term hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. Since 2014, these infections can be effectively treated with 8-12 weeks of oral therapies. In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) established targets to eliminate HCV by 2030, which included treatment targets for member countries. The current study examines HCV treatment patterns across 119 countries and regions from 2014 to 2023 to assess the impact of national programs. This study can assist physicians and policymakers in understanding treatment patterns within similar regions or income groups and in utilizing historical data to refine their strategies in the future.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nProtein phosphatase 6 regulates metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis via the mTORC1 pathway. \r\nPPP6C is directly activated by FGF21 via FGFRs/βKlotho and improves MASH features through dephosphorylation of TSC2 in hepatocytes. This study implies that pharmacological approaches, genetic or metabolic factors targeting PPP6C activity may offer attractive prospects for treating liver fibrosis and MASH.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Freiburg Index of Post-TIPS Survival (FIPS) identifies patients at risk for further decompensation and ACLF after TIPS.\r\nThe present study reveals that the FIPS predicts development of further decompensation and ACLF after TIPS implantation. These events are responsible for impaired transplant-free survival in FIPS high-risk patients. These results pave the way for the development of tailored clinical management strategies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nUnveiling the Molecular Legacy of Transient Insulin Resistance: Implications for Hepatic Metabolic Adaptability. \r\nTransient insulin receptor blockade also altered the liver's molecular clock, particularly affecting PPARα transcriptional responsiveness.

Poor prognosis was associated with low bile acid synthesis and aberrantly increased liver FGF19. Impact and implications Biliary atresia (BA), a fibro-obliterating biliary disease of infants, remains the most common indication for pediatric liver transplantation caused by rapid progression of liver injury. To identify predictive biomarkers of disease progression and to elucidate the pathophysiology of BA liver injury, we profiled serum bile acids and studied their liver metabolism after Kasai portoenterostomy. Accumulation and altered composition of circulating bile acids predicted progression of liver disease and need for liver transplantation. Patients with poor prognosis showed low bile acid synthesis and abnormal liver expression of fibroblast growth factor 19.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHyodeoxycholic acid ameliorates cholestatic liver fibrosis by facilitating m<sup>6<\/sup>A-regulated expression of a novel anti-fibrotic target ETV4.\r\nThe present study underscores ETV4 as a novel anti-fibrotic target and demonstrates that HDCA remodels ECM by facilitating m 6 A-regulated ETV4 expression, offering potential therapeutic approaches for cholestatic liver fibrosis. Impact and implications This study delves into the underlying mechanisms of cholestatic liver fibrosis and offers potential therapeutic targets. The research highlights ETV4 as a novel anti-fibrotic target and is essential for the therapeutic effects of hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA) against cholestatic liver fibrosis. These findings are important for both the scientific community and patients with cholestatic liver diseases, offering valuable insights for future therapeutic strategies that focus on regulating m 6 A-dependent epigenetic modifications of anti-fibrotic targets like ETV4 and developing new interventions utilizing HDCA.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLoss of SGK1 supports metastatic colonization in hepatocellular carcinoma by promoting resistance to T cell-mediated immunity.\r\nThese findings establish SGK1 as a crucial regulator of immune-mediated control over metastatic growth in HCC. SGK1 expression in metastatic lesions may serve as a predictive biomarker for response to immune checkpoint inhibitors, presenting new avenues for therapeutic intervention to overcome immune resistance in metastatic HCC. Impact and implications Despite metastasis is a common occurrence and lethal determinant in cancers, the mechanism underlying tumor immune evasion during metastatic seeding is unclear. Our study reveals that loss of Sgk1 renders metastatic tumor cells survival advantages against antitumor immune response by abrogating CD8 + T cell-induced RIPK1-dependent necroptosis. Growth of Sgk1-silenced metastasis led to infiltration of terminally exhausted CD8 + T cells, which could be reversed by immune checkpoint inhibitors administered at early stage of metastatic seeding. These findings provide valuable insights into potential therapeutic strategies targeting resistance to T cell immunity in cancer metastasis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMultiomic analysis uncovers a continuous spectrum of differentiation and Wnt-MDK-driven immune evasion in hepatoblastoma. \r\nOur novel findings, revealing a continuous spectrum of tumor differentiation states and Wnt-MDK-driven immune evasion, are significant for pediatric oncology clinicians and researchers, improving our functional understanding of the immune environment of hepatoblastoma. The identification of midkine as a tumor-specific immunomodulator suggests a potential for developing new targeted therapies, though further mechanistic and practical validation would be needed to realize clinical translation of these findings.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNumber of people treated for hepatitis C virus infection in 2014-2023 and applicable lessons for new HBV and HDV therapies.\r\nIn the last 10 years, 21% of al HCV infections were treated with DAAs. Regional and temporal variations highlight the importance of active screening strategies. Without program enhancements, the number of treated PLHCV stalled in every country/region which may not reflect a lower prevalence but may instead reflect the diminishing returns of the existing strategies. Impact and implications Long-term hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. Since 2014, these infections can be effectively treated with 8-12 weeks of oral therapies. In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) established targets to eliminate HCV by 2030, which included treatment targets for member countries. The current study examines HCV treatment patterns across 119 countries and regions from 2014 to 2023 to assess the impact of national programs. This study can assist physicians and policymakers in understanding treatment patterns within similar regions or income groups and in utilizing historical data to refine their strategies in the future.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Freiburg Index of Post-TIPS Survival (FIPS) identifies patients at risk for further decompensation and ACLF after TIPS. \r\nThese events are responsible for impaired transplant-free survival in FIPS high-risk patients.

If VCTE is unavailable, FIB-4 alone is a cost-effective alternative for MASLD patients with diabetes or 3 metabolic traits.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nElectronic Interventions to Improve Quality for Inpatient Cirrhosis Care: a prospective evaluation.\r\nBPAs should be used with care and are best in settings with low baseline utilization of quality indicators.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFecal Calprotectin Correlates with Disease Extent but Remains a Reliable Marker of Mucosal Healing in Ulcerative Colitis. \r\nHowever, FC remained a reliable marker of mucosal healing across al disease extents, with AUC ranging from 0.878 to 0.915, and no significant differences between the extent categories (DeLong´s test, p ≥ 0.2919). FC showed a significant association with disease extent yet remained a reliable surrogate marker for mucosal healing across al disease extents.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLONG-TERM PROGNOSIS OF NON-CELIAC ENTEROPATHIES AND A SCORE TO IDENTIFY PATIENTS WITH POOR OUTCOMES: A 30-YEAR MULTICENTER LONGITUDINAL STUDY.\r\nMortality in NCEs is increased due to complications and lack of response to current therapies. We developed a clinical score to personalise follow-up. Targeted treatments are needed to improve outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Gender-Equity Model for Liver Allocation using Artificial Intelligence (GEMA-AI) for waiting list liver transplant prioritization.\r\nThe use of explainable machine learning models may be preferred over conventional regression-based models for waiting list prioritization in LT. GEMA-AI made more accurate predictions of waiting list outcomes, particularly for the sickest patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopy\r\n    Clinician-reported Gloucester Comfort Scale scores underestimate patient discomfort and pain during colonoscopy: insights from comparison with a patient-reported experience measure. \r\nClinician-reported GCS scores frequently underestimate the level of discomfort and pain as reported by patients. For accurate monitoring of patients' colonoscopy experience, the use of PREMs should be considered.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOutcomes of Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection for High-Risk Colorectal Colitis-Associated Neoplasia in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\nESD of HR-CANs shows favorable outcomes on the medium and long-term course in IBD patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nStandard enhancement settings used on endoscopy systems significantly impair performance of artificial intelligence systems in endoscopy. \r\n This retrospective study indicates that performance of current endoscopic AI systems can substantially vary depending on the post-processing enhancement settings of the endoscopy unit. Specific data augmentation can mitigate this performance loss.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSurveillance of primary sclerosing cholangitis - a comparison of scheduled or on-demand ERCP with annual MRI surveillance: a multicenter study. \r\nNo differences were seen in liver-related deaths between the surveillance strategies. In this study comparing scheduled ERCP, annual MRI/MRCP surveillance, and on-demand ERCP, the strategy based on scheduled ERCP using individual risk stratification is associated with better overall prognosis and outcome.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Non-contrast magnetic resonance imaging versus ultrasonography for hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance: A randomized, single-center trial.\r\nNon-contrast MRI is a better alternative to US for the surveillance of cirrhotic patients offering earlier stage at initial diagnosis and lower false-positive referral rate. ClincalTrials.gov, NCT02514434.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    A Comparison of Endoscopic and Surgical Gastrojejunostomy in Patients with Malignant Gastric Outlet Obstruction: A National Cohort Analysis (2016-2020). \r\nCompared to surgical GJ, endoscopic GJ is associated with lower rates of peri-procedural adverse events, hospitalization charges, and length of stay. For these reasons, endoscopic GJ should be strongly considered in managing malignant gastric outlet obstruction.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterologists' Goals for Ergonomic Colonoscopes: Results of a National Survey. \r\nThe colonoscope changes respondents prioritized were those pertaining to customizability for hand size and more easily manipulated control surfaces. Professional societies and industry should work together to design scopes more aligned with best ergonomic principles.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLong-term outcomes after endoscopic eradication therapy for dysplastic and T1a adenocarcinoma related Barrett's esophagus: higher rate of late dysplastic recurrence with radio-frequency ablation monotherapy. \r\nThe risk of IM, dysplasia and late recurrence is higher when RFA was the sole modality used to achieve CRIM, raising the possibility that RFA provides a less durable response. These findings may impact treatment and surveillance decisions.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOutcomes of Anesthesia-Supported versus Endoscopist-Driven Sedation Modalities: A retrospective cohort study. \r\nThese were substantially lower than the rates for other sedation groups, and odds ratios were significantly lower than 1.00 (p<0.05) in 30 out of 36 comparisons across procedural, sedative, and outcome categories. Sedation achieved with Midazolam/Fentanyl correlated with a lower rate of adverse events but significantly longer PACU LOS compared to Propofol, Propofol + Adjuvants, or General Anesthesia.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPredicting the need for step-up after EUS-guided drainage of peripancreatic fluid collections, including Quadrant Necrosis Infection score validation: a prospective cohort study.\r\nThe high-risk QNI group was associated with a significantly longer hospital stay (12 days vs 4 days, p=0.004). EUS tended to upscale the necrotic content compared to preprocedural Radiology (κ=0.31) CONCLUSIONS: The extent of necrosis and the QNI classification strongly correlated with the need for step-up and allocation to LAMS vs DPPS drainage, proposing a central role in treatment personalization.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe effect of the timing of endoscopic detorsion on clinical outcomes in patients with sigmoid volvulus. \r\nThere does not appear to be a clear correlation between a longer delay until endoscopic detorsion and worse patient outcomes, with only the length of hospitalization affected. This suggests that endoscopic detorsion need not always be performed urgently.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    In vitro microbiota model recapitulates and predicts individualised sensitivity to dietary emulsifier. \r\nTransplant of human microbiotas that the MBRA model deemed CMC-sensitive, but not those deemed insensitive, into IL-10-/- germfree mice resulted in overt colitis following CMC feeding. These results suggest that an individual's sensitivity to emulsifier is a consequence of, and can thus be predicted by, examining their baseline microbiota, paving the way to microbiota-based personalised nutrition.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFasting-mimicking diet-enriched Bifidobacterium pseudolongum suppresses colorectal cancer by inducing memory CD8+ T cells. \r\nB. pseudolongum administration is a potential CRC therapeutic strategy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGlucocorticoid receptor suppresses GATA6-mediated RNA polymerase II pause release to modulate classical subtype identity in pancreatic cancer. \r\nConversely, in basal PDAC ΔNp63 promotes Pol II recruitment and stabilises enhancer-promoter interactions. This study provides new insights into the transcriptional control and role of GR agonists in controlling PDAC molecular subtype identity.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLow-coverage whole genome sequencing of low-grade dysplasia strongly predicts advanced neoplasia risk in ulcerative colitis. \r\nWithin-LGD lesion genetic heterogeneity did not confound risk prediction. Measurement of CNAs in LGD is an accurate predictor of AN risk in inflammatory bowel disease and is likely to support clinical management.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPredictors of response to low-dose amitriptyline for irritable bowel syndrome and efficacy and tolerability according to subtype: post hoc analyses from the ATLANTIS trial.\r\n These exploratory analyses demonstrate there are unlikely to be deleterious effects of amitriptyline in any particular IBS subtype and could help identify patients in whom amitriptyline may be more effective.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRisk factors for pancreatic cancer in individuals with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and no high-risk stigmata during up to 5 years of surveillance: a prospective longitudinal cohort study. \r\nIPMN size and its growth rate predict future pancreatic carcinoma risk only during first 5 years of follow-up. MPD diameter at 5 years may identify patients who still harbour a high risk for pancreatic carcinoma.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    Acute encephalopathy without hyperammonemia has a different presentation than overt hepatic encephalopathy and displays similarly severe prognosis. \r\nNonHep E accounts for one third of admissions for acute encephalopathy, and displays as severe prognosis as OHE. OHE is independently associated with lower transplant-free survival at one year.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClinical outcomes and care for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: A national cohort study. \r\nThe SBP bundle was associated with lower incidence of Stage 3 versus Stage 0-2 AKI (OR 0.66, 95%CI 0.51-0.86). Prospective implementation of evidence-based SBP bundles may improve care outcomes and mortality in SBP.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDiscovery of a MET-driven monogenic cause of steatotic liver disease. \r\nEight of 45 (17.7%) individuals had predicted deleterious variants in the MET kinase domain confirmed to be functionally like the familial case variant. We report the first germline non-malignant rare MET-driven disease, a monogenic form of SLD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIdentification of glycogen synthase kinase 3alpha/beta as a host factor required for hepatitis B virus transcription using high-throughput screening.\r\nOur recombinant HBV-based screening system enables the discovery of new targets. Using our approach, we identified GSK3 inhibitors as potential anti-HBV agents.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPSC and colitis: A complex relationship.\r\nWith this review, we aim to summarize the current knowledge on the gut-liver axis in PSC-IBD, provide new perspectives on risk stratification and treatment and identify gaps in our current knowledge. Our understanding of this complex relationship will therefore help to design clinical trials and shape the future therapy of PSC-IBD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPhosphoproteomics delineates hepatocellular carcinoma subtypes and pinpoints therapeutic targets. \r\nThe corresponding drug, bosutinib, demonstrated efficacy in inhibiting the growth of subtype C tumors in liver cancer cell lines and HCC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models representative of the phosphoproteomic HCC subtypes. Our study provides a comprehensive exploration of the phosphoproteomic landscape of HCC, establishing new subtypes that match clinical features and identifying potential therapeutic targets for the most malignant C subtype.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPrevalence and predictors of cirrhosis and portal hypertension in the united states. \r\nS. residents with cirrhosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nShort-term starvation boosts anti-PD-L1 therapy by reshaping tumor-associated macrophages in hepatocellular carcinoma. \r\nModulating FBP1/Akt/Rab27a axis potentiates the anti-PD-L1 response using two liposomal delivery systems and macrophage adoptive transfer. This study describes the immunomodulatory effects of STS and provides a rationale for its application as an adjuvant in HCC immunotherapy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTIGIT-expression on natural killer cell subsets is an early indicator of alleviating liver inflammation following bulevirtide treatment in chronic hepatitis D.\r\nWe here suggest that lacking the expression of the immune checkpoint inhibitor TIGIT on NK cell subtypes may be a hallmark of liver inflammation in HDV infection. BLV-therapy is associated with a reappearance of TIGIT on these cells, which may be one mechanism of why liver enzymes rapidly improve during therapy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Contrast-enhanced ultrasound-based AI model for multi-classification of focal liver lesions.\r\nCEUS-based Model -DCB provides accurate multi-classification of FLLs. It holds promise to benefit a wide range of population, especially for patients in remote suburban areas who have difficulty accessing MRI. Impact and implications Ultrasound is the most common image examination for screening focal liver lesions (FLLs), but it lacks accuracy for multi-classification, which is the prerequisite for reasonable management. Contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) offers better diagnostic performance, but highly relies on work experience of radiologists. We develop a CEUS-based model (Model -DCB ) can assist junior CEUS radiologists to achieve comparable diagnostic ability to senior CEUS radiologists and senior MRI radiologists. The combination of ultrasound device, CEUS examination and Model -DCB enables even patients in remote areas to obtain excellent diagnostic performance through examination by junior radiologists. Clinical trial NCT04682886.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGRINA alleviates hepatic ischemia‒reperfusion injury-induced apoptosis and ER-phagy by enhancing HRD1-mediated ATF6 ubiquitination.\r\nOur study highlights the critical role of the GRINA-HRD1-ATF6 complex in regulating ER stress and autophagy during HIRI. These findings provide new insights into therapeutic strategies to alleviate HIRI. Impact and implications HIRI represents a multifaceted pathophysiological challenge commonly encountered during liver surgeries, yet its underlying molecular mechanisms remain inadequately understood. In this study, we revealed a significant negative correlation between GRINA levels and the severity of liver damage in patients with HIRI. Our findings demonstrate that GRINA alleviates endoplasmic reticulum stress by enhancing HRD1-mediated ubiquitination of ATF6, thereby maintaining calcium homeostasis and inhibiting ER-phagy. This study provides novel insights into the role of GRINA in protecting liver cells under HIRI, offering fresh perspectives for clinical prevention and management strategies for HIRI.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatocellular CMPK2 promotes the development of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis.\r\nThese findings establish CMPK2 as a critical mediator in the progression from metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver (MASL) to MASH and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic diseases. Impact and implications CMPK2 exhibits upregulated in the MASH stage but not in the early stages of MASLD. Our study demonstrated that diet-induced MASH phenotypes, including liver injury, inflammation, and fibrosis were alleviated in hepatocyte-specific Cmpk2-knockout mice. These findings suggest that CMPK2 serve as a critical link in the progression of steatotic liver to steatohepatitis, offering novel mechanistic insights MASH development. Furthermore, this discovery identified CMPK2 as a promising target for the development of therapeutic drugs for MASH.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPrognostic performance of the two-step clinical care pathway in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.\r\nNon-invasive 2-step approach by FIB-4 followed by LSM is effective in classifying patients at different risks of LREs. Impact and implications Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is emerging as one of the leading causes of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide, but only a minority of patients will develop these complications. Therefore, it is necessary to use non-invasive tests instead of liver biopsy for risk stratification. Additionally, as most patients with MASLD are seen in primary care instead of specialist settings, cost and availability of the tests should be taken into consideration. In this multicentre study, the use of Fibrosis-4 index followed by liver stiffness measurement by vibration-controlled transient elastography effectively identified patients who would later develop liver-related events. The results support current recommendations by various regional guidelines on a clinical care pathway based on non-invasive tests to diagnose advanced liver fibrosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Editorial: Alpha2-Delta Ligands in Irritable Bowel Syndrome. \r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Development and Validation of a Multimodal Machine Learning Model for Diagnosing and Assessing Risk of Crohn's Disease in Patients With Perianal Fistula.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Steatotic Liver Diseases Emerge as Rapidly Growing Drivers of Primary Liver Cancer in the United States.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Blue Notes.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nContinuing the Commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Within AGA Journals.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    Clinical Applications of Device-Assisted Enteroscopy: A Comprehensive Review. \r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease in children.\r\nMASLD is a complex disease affecting one in ten children and is associated with increased early mortality risk.

DCE was superior for dysplasia detection in colonic IBD. DCE was superior to HD-WLE in colonic IBD. DCE was the best technique in UC. Further studies to compare HD-WLE-SR and NBI with DCE are warranted to ascertain performance equivalency and define the optimal surveillance technique.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Eradication Therapy to Prevent Gastric Cancer in H. pylori-positive individuals: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials and Observational Studies.\r\nThis meta-analysis provides further evidence that administering eradication therapy prevents gastric cancer in H. pylori-positive individuals, with consistency in results among studies of different design.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Disparities in Alcohol-Associated Liver Disease Hospital Encounters Amongst a Texas-Based Cohort of Patients.\r\n The highest increases of alcohol-associated encounters were observed amongst young Hispanic and NHB women, highlighting variation in trends by age, sex, race and ethnicity. These disparities merit further investigation to elucidate underlying mechanisms and develop tailored interventions to improve ALD burden and outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHead-to-Head Comparison Between Phosphatidylethanol Versus Indirect Alcohol Biomarkers for Diagnosis of MetALD Versus MASLD: A Prospective Study.\r\nPEth outperforms previously used non-invasive tests in differentiating MetALD from MASLD and has the potential to change clinical practice by enhancing the subclassification of SLD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nObesity Is Associated With Worsened Outcomes in Patients With Ulcerative Colitis on Advanced Therapies: A Propensity Matched Cohort Study From the U.S.\r\nObesity is associated with lower efficacy of several advanced therapies in patients with UC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRetrospective Cohort Study: Scope for Improvement-Barriers to Post-Polypectomy Surveillance in the Integrated Technologies for Improved Polyp Surveillance Cohort.\r\n Patients from more socioeconomically deprived areas are less likely to have appropriate post-polypectomy surveillance, and are more likely to have metachronous polyps and colorectal cancer even when they do. Conclusion Surveillance strategies must take into account factors including socioeconomic deprivation and comorbidity exist to improve surveillance uptake in this group through the design of targeted interventions which move away from the current \"one size fits all\" approach.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAm J Gastroenterol\r\n    Clinical Outcomes in A Multi-center Cohort Involving 919 Patients with Hypertriglyceridemia-associated Acute Pancreatitis.\r\nUsing a multi-center cross-regional cohort, we demonstrated that HTG-AP had a higher risk of developing severe AP and organ failure. A risk prediction model for predicting severe AP was developed and effectively stratified patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDiscovery of Methylated DNA Biomarkers for Potential Non-Endoscopic Detection of Barrett's Esophagus and Esophageal Adenocarcinoma.\r\nThis discriminatory biomarker panel algorithm exemplifies a practical nonendoscopic strategy to diagnose BE, HGD, and EAC using a minimally-invasive sponge-capsule device coupled with DNA methylation markers.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nENHANCEMENT OF CIRRHOSIS MORTALITY PREDICTION BY INCLUDING HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY TO MELD3.0 IN A NATIONAL VETERAN COHORT.\r\nThe addition of HE to MELD3.0 and MELD-Na significantly improved their mortality prediction with interactions at 90-days and 1-year on multivariable regression. A documented inpatient HE episode is additive to the mortality prediction of MELD3.0 by 4-5 extra points and could enhance future MELD iterations.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHigh Cirrhosis Surgical Volume Centers have Reduced Postoperative Mortality in Patients with Cirrhosis Undergoing Major Surgery.\r\nIn this retrospective cohort study of 14,500 major surgeries in patients with cirrhosis, we found in adjusted analysis that high-volume centers (>16 surgeries in past year) had a 36% reduced hazard of post-operative mortality through 90 days versus low-volume centers (<9 surgeries in past year;  hazard ratio 0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.43-0.94, p=0.02). These findings demonstrate the importance of triaging patients with cirrhosis to high-volume centers for major surgery when feasible.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHigher Relapse Rate in HBeAg-negative Patients After Cessation of Tenofovir Alafenamide Compared to Entecavir or Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate.\r\nThere is an earlier and higher HBV relapse rate in patients who discontinue TAF therapy than in comparable patients discontinuing entecavir or TDF therapy. Close monitoring is necessary after TAF withdrawal, particularly in the first 3 months.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMedications for Alcohol Use Disorder Are Increasingly Being Prescribed in American Patients with Advanced Liver Disease.\r\nThe rate of AUD medication discontinuation for adverse events was similar in both groups (14% vs 12%). Naltrexone, acamprosate, and disulfiram are increasingly being prescribed in American patients with mild and severe ALD with similar tolerability and efficacy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPeriodontitis and the incidence of inflammatory bowel diseases: A nationwide population-based cohort study.\r\nPeriodontitis may augment the risk of incidence for CD and UC.

GEMA-AI made more accurate predictions of waiting list outcomes, particularly for the sickest patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopy\r\n    Outcomes of Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection for High-Risk Colorectal Colitis-Associated Neoplasia in Inflammatory Bowel Disease. \r\nPost-resection surgery was required in 11.5% (95%CI 0.114;  0.058-0.195) of cases. ESD of HR-CANs shows favorable outcomes on the medium and long-term course in IBD patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Physiological Data Collected from Wearable Devices Identify and Predict Inflammatory Bowel Disease Flares.\r\nLongitudinally collected physiological metrics from wearable devices can identify and change prior to IBD flares, suggesting their feasibility to monitor and predict IBD activity.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    Computer-Assisted Classification of the Squamocolumnar Junction.\r\n Our computer-generated model was capable of auto-segmentation and classification of the z-line. We established a threshold of complexity using wavelet energy coefficient to standardize the classification of the SCJ.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopy and Anesthesia Outcomes Associated with Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonist use in Patients Undergoing Outpatient Upper Endoscopy.\r\n Patients on GLP1RAs have increased rates of solid RGCs during upper endoscopy, but not with concurrent colonoscopy, and higher rates of aborted procedures, but similar rates of adverse anesthesia events.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPredicting the need for step-up after EUS-guided drainage of peripancreatic fluid collections, including Quadrant Necrosis Infection score validation: a prospective cohort study.\r\nThe high-risk QNI group was associated with a significantly longer hospital stay (12 days vs 4 days, p=0.004). EUS tended to upscale the necrotic content compared to preprocedural Radiology (κ=0.31) CONCLUSIONS: The extent of necrosis and the QNI classification strongly correlated with the need for step-up and allocation to LAMS vs DPPS drainage, proposing a central role in treatment personalization.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Clinical Utility of Incorporating Next-Generation Sequencing Results in the Management Algorithm of Pancreatic Cysts.\r\n NGS informed surgical decision-making, cyst type differentiation, and evaluation of pancreatic duct dilation, leading to changes in management. Indeed, NGS emerges as a useful tool in select patients with pancreatic lesions by improving diagnostic precision and guiding patient care paths.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nYield of Esophageal Biopsy Patterns for the Diagnosis of Eosinophilic Esophagitis.\r\nIsolated segmental eosinophilia is common in EoE, including up to 10% non-distal disease. Discordant mid and proximal biopsy findings are prevalent, with no isolated proximal eosinophilia. Standard protocol should include routine biopsies of both distal and middle esophagus to maximize diagnostic yield.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    Surveillance in inflammatory bowel disease: white light endoscopy with segmental re-inspection versus dye-based chromoendoscopy - a multi-arm randomised controlled trial (HELIOS).\r\nHD white-light endoscopy with segmental re-inspection was non-inferior to HD chromoendoscopy for colorectal neoplasia detection in IBD patients. It can therefore be assumed that the benefit of HD chromoendoscopy may be explained by the longer withdrawal time and not necessarily the enhanced contrast. However, re-inspection per se did not lead to a significantly higher colorectal neoplasia rate than single-pass HD white-light endoscopy alone.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTargeting MXD1 sensitises pancreatic cancer to trametinib.\r\nOur study has discovered an important mechanism for trametinib resistance and identified MXD1 as a druggable target in treatment of trametinib-resistant PDAC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nUnlocking novel T cell-based immunotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma through neoantigen-driven T cell receptor isolation.\r\n These findings offer valuable insights into the functional profiles of neoantigen-reactive T cells within and surrounding the HCC microenvironment. T cells isolated from liver flushes and tumour-draining lymph nodes may serve as a promising source of reactive T cells and TCRs for further use in immunotherapy for HCC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    Identification of glycogen synthase kinase 3alpha/beta as a host factor required for hepatitis B virus transcription using high-throughput screening.\r\nOur recombinant HBV-based screening system enables the discovery of new targets. Using our approach, we identified GSK3 inhibitors as potential anti-HBV agents.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLong-term outcome and risk stratification in compensated advanced chronic liver disease after HCV-cure.\r\nBaveno VII criteria to exclude (FU-liver stiffness measurement 3 y). One-time post-treatment risk stratification based on noninvasive criteria provides important prognostic information that is maintained during long-term follow-up, as the hazards remain proportional over time.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPSC and colitis: A complex relationship.\r\nWith this review, we aim to summarize the current knowledge on the gut-liver axis in PSC-IBD, provide new perspectives on risk stratification and treatment and identify gaps in our current knowledge. Our understanding of this complex relationship will therefore help to design clinical trials and shape the future therapy of PSC-IBD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTIGIT-expression on natural killer cell subsets is an early indicator of alleviating liver inflammation following bulevirtide treatment in chronic hepatitis D.\r\nWe here suggest that lacking the expression of the immune checkpoint inhibitor TIGIT on NK cell subtypes may be a hallmark of liver inflammation in HDV infection. BLV-therapy is associated with a reappearance of TIGIT on these cells, which may be one mechanism of why liver enzymes rapidly improve during therapy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Circulating monocytes upregulate CD52 and sustain innate immune function in cirrhosis unless acute decompensation emerges.\r\n CD52 may represent a biologically relevant target for future immunotherapy. Stabilising CD52 may enhance monocyte functions and infection control in the context of cirrhosis, guided by sCD52/PLC as biomarkers indicating immuneparesis. Impact and implications Monocyte dysfunction substantially contributes to infection susceptibility which determines the prognosis of cirrhosis patients, and represents a critical condition with unmet therapeutic needs. Its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood, although among hepatologists a better understanding of the monocyte pathophysiology in relation to cirrhosis stages, and a therapeutic reconstitution of monocyte function are believed to enhance defence against infection and thus reduce morbidity and mortality of patients with cirrhosis in the future. By systematically delineating the heterogeneity and function of circulating monocytes ex vivo, we identified that the absence of CD52 expression on monocytes represented a distinct biomarker of monocyte dysfunction in patients with cirrhosis, discriminating patients at substantial risk for infectious complications. Otherwise, given the beneficial antimicrobial functions of CD52-expressing monocytes, CD52-stablisation may also represent such a target for immunotherapy worth exploring, at it has been desired in clinical practise.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nContrast-enhanced ultrasound-based AI model for multi-classification of focal liver lesions. \r\nThe combination of ultrasound device, CEUS examination and Model-DCB enables even patients in remote areas to obtain excellent diagnostic performance through examination by junior radiologists. NCT04682886.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGenomic and transcriptomic signatures of sequential carcinogenesis from papillary neoplasm to biliary tract cancer.\r\nWith the largest IPN/ICPN cohort reported to date, our study provides a genome- and spatial transcriptome-level portrait of sequential carcinogenesis and differences in the anatomical location of biliary papillary neoplasms. Impact and implications Biliary tract cancer is a fatal malignancy. However, its genome-level sequential carcinogenesis from intraepithelial neoplasia to carcinoma has not yet been evaluated in a sufficiently large cohort. Papillary lesions of the bile duct and gallbladder are collectively termed intraductal papillary neoplasms (IPN) of the bile duct and intracholecystic papillary neoplasms (ICPN), respectively. They are primarily diagnosed based on histopathological studies. This study provides a comprehensive mutational and spatial transcriptomic landscape of papillary neoplasms of the bile duct and gallbladder. The results of this study offer insights into the mechanism of sequential carcinogenesis in papillary biliary tract tumors, pathology-genomics correlation, and potential therapeutic targets.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nModeling the Health and Economic Impact of Pharmacologic Therapies for MASLD in the United States.\r\nIncreasing diagnosis and treatment for the MASLD population with moderate-to-advanced fibrosis will prevent advanced liver disease and death and will result in reducing the associated direct healthcare costs. Increasing awareness, screening and diagnosis along with introducing pharmacologic therapies that halt fibrosis progression are necessary to realize health and economic benefits for the MASLD population. Impact and implications MASLD, the most rapidly increasing and prevalent liver disease, leads to chronic liver disease which generates substantial health care costs. As disease burden and costs mount, pharmacologic therapy which halts MASLD fibrosis progression is coming to fruition. Modeling the impact on disease progression of a hypothetical pharmacologic therapy which halts MASLD fibrosis progression through multiple scenarios provides insights into the key drivers of the disease and costs associated with it to facilitate best policies and practices to mitigate the burden of MASLD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPan-PPAR agonist lanifibranor improves insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in patients with T2D and MASLD.\r\nLanifibranor significantly improves hepatic, muscle and adipose tissue insulin resistance. Lanifibranor treatment was safe and effective in reducing hepatic steatosis and cardiometabolic risk factors associated with metabolic dysfunction. Impact and implications No prior studies have evaluated the effect of lanifibranor on insulin sensitivity at the level of muscle, liver and adipose tissue and its relationship to changes in intrahepatic triglyceride (IHTG) content in insulin resistant subjects with MASLD and T2D. We observed a significant decrease in IHTG after 24 weeks of treatment (by ∼50%, p < 0.001 versus placebo) that was associated with a major improvement in hepatic and peripheral (Rd) insulin sensitivity, restoration of adipose tissue function with more than two-fold increase in plasma adiponectin concentration and improvement in cardiometabolic risk factors. This is the first in-depth study on how a pan-PPAR approach reverses steatosis and metabolic dysfunction in patients with T2D and MASLD. It has important clinical implications because it offers proof-of-concept that by targeting the key underlying metabolic defects in MASLD (i.e., insulin resistance, lipotoxicity and hyperglycemia) one can restore cardiometabolic health and offers a compelling rationale for treating with lanifibranor individuals with MASLD, either alone or in combination with weight loss and other treatment strategies.
