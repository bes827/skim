Methods This CPU was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC) and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership and underwent internal peer review by the CPUC and external peer review through standard procedures of Gastroenterology.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeta-analysis\r\nmeta-analyses and systematic reviews\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Improving primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding by adapting therapy to the clinical stage of cirrhosis. A competing-risk meta-analysis of individual participant data.\r\nIn patients with compensated cirrhosis and high-risk varices on primary prophylaxis, NSBBs significantly improved survival vs EVL, with no additional benefit noted adding EVL to NSBBs. In decompensated patients, survival was similar with both therapies. The study suggests that NSBBs are preferable when advising preventive therapy in compensated patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAm J Gastroenterol\r\n    Performance of prediction models for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in general population: a systematic review and external validation study.\r\n Several prediction models showed moderate performance in external validation and the prediction models may be useful in screening for ESCC. Further research is needed on model optimization, generalization, and implementation, as well as health economic evaluation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    Letter to the Editor: Diagnostic accuracy of AGILE3+ score for advanced fibrosis in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReply: Diagnostic accuracy of AGILE3+score for advanced fibrosis in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Clinical trial: Combination allopurinol-thiopurine versus standard thiopurine in patients with IBD escalating to immunomodulators (the DECIDER study).\r\n Thiopurine-allopurinol therapy is safe and mitigates thiopurine adverse effects, thus enhancing tolerability without compromising efficacy (ACTRN12613001347752).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDietary index based on the Food Standards Agency nutrient profiling system and risk of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.\r\nA diet with low nutritional quality as measured by the FSAm-NPS-DI Score is associated with a higher risk of CD but not UC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAm J Gastroenterol\r\n    EPIDEMIOLOGY, COMORBIDITIES, AND TREATMENT OF CYCLIC VOMITING SYNDROME IN THE UNITED STATES.\r\nThis study provides the first population-level estimates of CVS incidence and prevalence in the US. Comorbid conditions are common, and most patients with CVS do not receive adequate treatment. These findings underscore the need for improving disease awareness and developing better screening strategies and effective treatments.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEfficacy and Safety of Ustekinumab for Ulcerative Colitis Through 4 Years: Final Results of the UNIFI Long-term Maintenance Study.\r\nThe long-term efficacy of ustekinumab maintenance in patients with UC was confirmed through 4 years. No new safety signals were observed.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMeasuring size of colorectal polyps using a virtual scale endoscope or visual assessment: A randomized controlled trial.\r\nVSE significantly improves the size measurement accuracy of colorectal polyps during colonoscopies compared to VA and results in fewer misclassifications at relevant decision-making size thresholds.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPotential Cost Savings in Medicare Part D Across Gastroenterology; An Assessment of Alternative Drug Sourcing.\r\n Disproportionate Part D spending likely reflects less competitive acquisition cost. Provider awareness of medications with advantaged price may promote targeted prescribing with potentially tremendous healthcare savings.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nUnderstanding predictors of fatigue over time in persons with IBD: The importance of depressive and anxiety symptoms.\r\nAnxiety, depression and pain predicted fatigue impact over time in IBD, suggesting that targeting psychological factors and pain for intervention may lessen fatigue burden.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nUtilizing the Diabetes Care System for A County-wide Hepatitis C Elimination: An Integrated Community-based Shared Care Model in Taiwan.\r\n Although HCV prevalence varied, the care cascades achieved consistent results across townships/cities. We have further successfully implemented the model in county-wide hospital-based diabetes clinics, eventually treating 89.6% of the total PwD. A collaborative effort between diabetes care and HCV elimination enhanced the testing and treatment in PwD through an innovative shared care model.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Older patients with ACLF have a higher waitlist mortality, but acceptable post-LT survival when compared to younger patients.\r\n Older patients with Est-CLF had significantly higher waitlist mortality than younger patients, but had acceptable 1-year post-LT survival including those with Est-ACLF-3;  therefore age alone should not be considered as a contraindication for LT. Older patients with respiratory failure should be carefully selected for LT.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nProspective comparison of ATI and CAP for liver steatosis diagnosis in patients with NAFLD and type 2 diabetes.\r\n ATI may be used as an alternative to CAP for the diagnosis and quantification of steatosis, in patients with T2D and NAFLD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndosc Int Open\r\n    A stag beetle knife can achieve stabler and safer endoscopic submucosal dissection in the esophagus.\r\nPerforming esophageal ESD with an SB knife is a safe procedure with less variation in procedure time and less muscule exposure.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAnalysis of adverse events with lumen apposing metal stents for drainage of pancreatic fluid collections.\r\nEndoscopists should be aware of the risk factors for LAMS-related bleeding and tailor their drainage strategy, including utilization of plastic stents for drainage of pseudocysts and adherence to a strict imaging interval and follow-up protocol.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAntibiotic prophylaxis and post-procedure infectious complications in endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with peroral cholangioscopy.\r\nNo reduction in infectious complication rates and AEs was seen with AP administration for SOC. The continued need for AP in SOC remains uncertain.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nColorectal serrated lesions and polyps in the Danish population: A large nationwide register-based cohort study.\r\nFrom 2019 to 2021 the number of SPs seem to stabilize, while the proportion of SSLs keeps rising. Synchronous lesions were common along al subtypes of SP.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopic ultrasound-guided perivascular pancreatic radiofrequency ablation using a hydroxyethyl starch solution prior to pancreatectomy.\r\nPreoperative perivascular augmented RFA using HES was safe, and in the pancreatic animal model, the best timeframe was within 24 hours before pancreatic surgery. This technique might improve resectability in selected borderline and locally advanced pancreatic cancers.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointestinal bleeding in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: Long-term results of endoscopic treatment.\r\nEndoscopic treatment of gastrointestinal teleangiectases for gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with HHT is effective in the long term and safe.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nManagement of foreign body ingestion in adults: Time to STOP and rethink endoscopy.\r\nConservative management for patients presenting with recurrent high-risk foreign body ingestion was safe in appropriately selected cases. Re-presentation is common and poses significant challenges for health care providers.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRepeat bidirectional double-balloon enteroscopy 1 year later may be proper in Peutz-Jeghers patients with difficult-to-reach polyps.\r\nThe difficult-to-reach polyps may have a low risk of immediate symptomatic intussusception, possibly due to limited bowel mobility by extraluminal adhesions, and the likelihood of reaching them at repeat DBE was substantial. Hence, repeat DBE 1 year later may be proper in such patients with PJS.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nUtility of gastroscopy in the left lateral semi-recumbent position: A blood-free coup!\r\nThese data show that endotherapy in the left lateral semi-recumbent position is feasible, safe, and effective. It should be done when endoscopy in the left lateral decubitus position reveals a pool of blood in the fundus and there is inadequate visualization of the fundus.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopy\r\n    Post-colonoscopy colorectal cancers in a national FIT-based CRC screening program.\r\nThe 3-year PCCRC rate was low in this FIT-based CRC screening program. Approximately half of PCCRCs were interval PCCRCs. These were mostly caused by missed lesions and were diagnosed at more advanced stage. This emphasizes the importance of high-quality colonoscopy with optimal polyp detection.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    A Randomized Controlled Phase 2 Dose-Finding Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Camostat in the Treatment of Painful Chronic Pancreatitis: The TACTIC Study.\r\n We were not able to reject the null hypothesis of no difference in improvements in pain or quality of life outcomes in participants with painful CP who received camostat compared to placebo. Studies are needed to further define mechanisms of pain in CP to guide future clinical trials, including minimizing placebo responses and selecting targeted therapies. (NCT02693093).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDysbiosis and associated stool features improve prediction of response to biological therapy in inflammatory bowel disease.\r\n Faecal characterization based on microbial load, moisture content, calprotectin concentration, and enterotyping may aid in the therapeutic choice of biological therapy in IBD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFibroblast-Derived Lysyl Oxidase Increases Oxidative Phosphorylation and Stemness in Cholangiocarcinoma.\r\nIncreased LOX is driven by stromal inflammatory cancer-associated fibroblasts and correlates with diminished survival of patients with CCA. Modulating the LOX activity can serve as a novel tumor microenvironment-directed therapeutic strategy in bile duct pathologies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSex, genotype, and liver volume progression as risk of hospitalization determinants in autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease.\r\nBoth imaging and clinical genetic scoring have the potential to inform patients about the risk of developing symptomatic disease throughout their lives. The combination of female sex, germline PRKCSH alteration, and rapid TLV-progression is associated with the greatest odds of PLD-related hospitalization.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    Bilevel positive airway pressure ventilation in patients susceptible to hypoxemia during procedural sedation for colonoscopy: A prospective randomized controlled study.\r\nIn individuals with OSA or overweight status, the use of BPAP ventilation during colonoscopy significantly reduced the incidence of hypoxemia.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nBiliary Drainage in Hilar and Perihilar Cholangiocarcinoma; 25-Year Experience at a Tertiary Cancer Center.\r\n The relatively higher clinical success of SEMS is countered by the higher stent-specific complication rate. PS can be removed and may better facilitate PTBD. Within PS types, DPTs may have fewer stent-specific AEs. Cases requiring balloon dilation and with endoscopic evidence of pus may benefit from earlier reintervention.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCLINICAL PREDICTIVE VALUE OF RENALASE IN POST-ERCP PANCREATITIS.\r\n Baseline native renalase levels are very sensitive for predicting PEP. Further studies are needed to determine the potential clinical role of renalase in predicting and preventing PEP.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDoes successful EUS-guided pancreatic cyst chemoablation safely allow reduction in the frequency of radiographic surveillance? Long-term follow-up of randomized prospective data.\r\nThe ChARM Post-Treatment Reduced Radiographic Surveillance Protocol safely allows a reduction in radiographic surveillance. A reduction in cost associated with cyst management under the ChARM protocol was shown when compared to management following Fukukoa or ACG guidelines. According to the questionnaire, most patients reported a moderate level of logistical and emotional burden associated with MRI surveillance, and a majority were in favor of reducing the frequency of radiographic surveillance if it can be done without a marked increase in oncologic risk.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOutcomes of Cold Snare Endoscopic Mucosal Resection of Nonampullary Duodenal Adenomas =1 cm: A Multicenter Study.\r\n This retrospective multicenter study demonstrates that cs-EMR for nonampullary duodenal adenomas is safe and technically feasible with an acceptable recurrence rate. Future prospective studies are needed to directly compare outcomes of cs-EMR with conventional and underwater EMR.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPost-ERCP Cholecystitis: Incidence, Characteristics, and Outcomes from a Prospective Multi-center Biliary Endoscopy Registry.\r\nEstimates of post-ERCP cholecystitis incidence can inform discussions around procedural risk.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSafety and Efficacy of Direct Percutaneous Endoscopic Jejunostomy Tube Placement Compared with Surgical Jejunostomy: A Tertiary Care Analysis.\r\n DPEJ is a safe and effective alternative to surgical jejunostomy in eligible patients and may be associated with decreased complication rates at 90-days.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    Adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma.\r\nMoreover, major pathological responses reported from early phase 2 data in the neoadjuvant setting provide a strong rational for the evaluation of these concepts in phase 3 trials. In this review, we summarize current evidence and outline future directions for systemic therapies in early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAssociation of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists with serious liver events among patients with type 2 diabetes: A scandinavian cohort study.\r\nUse of GLP-1 receptor agonists was associated with a significantly reduced risk of serious liver events, driven by a reduction of compensated and decompensated cirrhosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDefining an approach for therapeutic strategies in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease after liver transplantation.\r\nDespite the oversized clinical burden of MASLD among LT recipients, there is currently a lack of regulatory approach and pathway for therapeutics development in this patient population. The present document, thus, provides guidance for therapeutics development that incorporates nuances of transplant care in patients with post-LT MASLD to facilitate drug development.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEffects of trientine and penicillamine on intestinal copper uptake: A mechanistic 64Cu PET/CT study in healthy humans.\r\nIn this mechanistic study, we show that TRI inhibits intestinal copper absorption, in addition to its cupriuretic effect. In contrast, PEN has modest effects on the intestinal absorption. This may explain why TRI and PEN are equally effective although urinary copper excretion is lower with TRI. The study questions whether the same therapeutic targets for 24-hour urinary excretion apply to both drugs.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInborn errors of type I interferon immunity in patients with symptomatic acute hepatitis E.\r\nOur results highlight the essential role of type I interferon in preventing symptomatic acute hepatitis E.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPortable hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion for organ preservation in liver transplantation (PILOTTM): A randomized, open-label, clinical trial.\r\nHMP-O2 demonstrates safety and noninferior efficacy for liver graft preservation in comparison to SCS. EAD by L-GrAFT7 was lower in HMP-O2, suggesting improved early clinical function. Recipients of HMP-O2 livers also demonstrated a lower incidence PNF and biliary strictures, although this difference did not reach significance.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPrevalence, distribution and hepatic fibrosis burden of the different subtypes of steatotic liver disease in primary care settings.\r\nAlmost al the NAFLD patients met the new criteria for MASLD. The fibrosis burden of the MetALD group was higher than those of the MASLD and ALD groups.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSumoylation of methionine adenosyltransferase alpha 1 promotes mitochondrial dysfunction in alcohol-associated liver disease.\r\nTaken together, our findings demonstrate an essential role for SUMOylation of MATa1 K48 for interaction with PIN1 in ALD. Preventing MATa1 K48 SUMOylation may represent a potential treatment strategy in ALD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nm6A-mediated gluconeogenic enzyme PCK1 upregulation protects against hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury.\r\nOur study found that activation of the METTL3/m6A-PCK1-gluconeogenesis axis is required to protect against hepatic I/R injury, providing potential intervention approaches for alleviating hepatic I/R injury during liver surgery.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    A new clinical and prognostic characterization of the patterns of decompensation of cirrhosis.\r\nIn almost 50% outpatients the first decompensation is a NAD, which is associated with a decreased survival than patients with ND. Patients who develop NAD must be treated with extreme care and monitored closely to prevent any development of AD. Impact and implications This multicenter study is the first to investigate the role of NAD in patients with cirrhosis. In fact, while the unfavorable impact of AD is well known, NAD is currently a phenomenon existing in clinical practice but never studied. Our data show that almost half of the decompensations in patients with cirrhosis are attributable to NAD and that this involves a higher risk of mortality compared to compensated patients. This study has important clinical implications because it highlights the need to carefully consider patients who develop NAD, in order to prevent further decompensation and reduce mortality.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAn open-label randomised-controlled trial of azathioprine vs. mycophenolate mofetil for the induction of remission in treatment-naive autoimmune hepatitis.\r\nIn patients with treatment-naive AIH, MMF with prednisolone achieved a significantly higher rate of biochemical remission at 24 weeks compared to azathioprine combined with prednisolone. Azathioprine use was associated with more (serious) adverse events leading to cessation of treatment, suggesting superior tolerability of MMF. Impact and implications This randomised controlled trial directly compares azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), both in combination with prednisolone, for the induction of biochemical remission in treatment-naive patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). Achieving complete remission is desirable to prevent disease progression. Patients assigned to the MMF group reached biochemical remission more often and experienced fewer adverse events. The findings in this trial may contribute to the re-evaluation of international guidelines for the standard of care in treatment-naive patients with AIH.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEffects of tetrathiomolybdate on copper metabolism in healthy volunteers and in patients with Wilson disease.\r\nWhile we did not show an increase in biliary excretion of 64 Cu following TTM administration, we demonstrated that TTM effectively inhibited most intestinal 64 Cu uptake and retained 64 Cu in the blood stream, limiting 64 Cu exposure to organs like the liver and the brain. Impact and implications Bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) is an investigational copper chelator for treatment of Wilson Disease. In animal studies of Wilson Disease models, TTM has been shown to facilitate biliary copper excretion. In the present human study, TTM surprisingly did not facilitate biliary copper excretion but instead reduced intestinal copper uptake to a clinically significant degree. Our study improves the understanding of human copper metabolism and the mechanism of action of TTM. Clinical trial number Data is presented from two clinical trials Absorption study  EudraCT 2020-005832-31Excretion study  EudraCT 2021-000102-25.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEpisodic overt hepatic encephalopathy after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt does not increase mortality in patients with cirrhosis.\r\n Episodic OHE after TIPS is not associated with mortality in patients undergoing TIPS, regardless of the indication. Impact and implications Overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) is a common complication in patients with advanced liver disease and it is particularly frequent following transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement. In cirrhotic patients outside the setting of TIPS, the development of OHE negatively impacts survival, regardless of the severity of cirrhosis or the presence of acute on chronic liver failure. With this multicenter, non-inferiority observational study we demonstrated that post-TIPS OHE does not increase the risk of mortality in patients undergoing TIPS, irrespective of the indication. This finding alleviates concerns regarding the weight of this complication after TIPS. Thus, intensive research of factors improving patient selection, and allowing risk stratification remains crucial to ameliorate the quality of life of patients and caregivers and to avoid undermining the positive effects on survival in patients undergoing TIPS.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatic prohibitin 1 and methionine adenosyltransferase a1 defend against primary and secondary liver cancer metastasis.\r\n We have identified an PHB1/MAT1A-MAFG/FOSB-MMP-7 axis that controls primary liver cancer metastasis and sensitization to CRLM.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLong-term use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate increases fracture risk in elderly patients with chronic hepatitis B.\r\nThe risk of fracture increased with TDF treatment for =24 months in elderly patients with CHB. Selection of nucleos(t)ide analogues should be individualised based on age and comorbidities. Impact and implications Previous literature suggested that the use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is associated with a decrease in bone mineral density. However, data on the impact of TDF on long-term incident clinical fracture remains scarce. In this real-world territory-wide study of 41,531 treated patients with chronic hepatitis B in Hong Kong, patients who received TDF were associated with a higher risk of fracture after two years of treatment as compared to those who received entecavir. Given the ageing population of patients with chronic hepatitis B with a rising prevalence of comorbidities, our findings support the current treatment guidelines on selection of antiviral treatment based on age and comorbidities.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPreventing liver disease with policy measures to tackle alcohol consumption and obesity: the HEPAHEALTH II study.\r\n Policy measures tackling primary risk factors for CLD and liver cancer, such as the implementation of an MUP of €1 and/or an MUP of €0.70 plus SSB tax could markedly reduce the number of Europeans with CLD or liver cancer.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the publisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    AP&T: Editors' declarations of interest.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Antibiotics as a risk factor for irritable bowel syndrome.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Bile acid diarrhoea - simplified clinico-biochemical diagnosis.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Is there a relationship between dysphagia, chest pain and mucosal innervation in patients with oesophageal motility disorders?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Monitoring methotrexate polyglutamates in Crohn's disease.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Moving towards prognostic endoscopic scoring in IBD.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Resmetirom - a promising treatment option for NASH and liver fibrosis.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Unmasking the silent threat-acute kidney injury in alcohol-associated hepatitis.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Birth cohort colorectal cancer (CRC): implications for research and practice.\r\nWe also outline implications of birth cohort CRC for epidemiologic and translational research, as well as current clinical practice. We postulate that recognition of birth cohort CRC as an entity - including and extending beyond rising EOCRC - can advance understanding of risk factors, etiologies, and mechanisms, and address the public health consequences of changing CRC epidemiology.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndosc Int Open\r\n    Are real-world data studies on bowel preparation for colonoscopy necessary?

In this review, we discuss the potential mechanism and entanglement between liver fibrosis and hyperinsulinemia and we hypothesise that the measure of fasting insulin could become a hepatic functional test within the armamentarium of non-invasive tests for the assessment of MASLD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInhibition of CAF-1 histone chaperone complex triggers cytosolic DNA and dsRNA sensing pathways and induces intrinsic immunity of hepatocellular carcinoma.\r\n Our findings suggest that CAF-1 is essential for HCC development, targeting CAF-1 may awaken the anti-cancer immune response and may work cooperatively with ICI treatment in cancer therapy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nUBXN9 inhibits the RNA exosome function to promote T cell control of liver tumorigenesis.\r\nOur results reveal a modality in which UBXN9 promotes the stimulatory RNA-induced RIG-I-IFN signaling that induces anti-tumor T cell response in liver tumorigenesis. Targeted manipulation of the UBXN9-RNA exosome circuit may have the potential to reinstate the immune control of liver tumor growth.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Comprehensive gene profiling of the metabolic landscape of humanized livers in mice.\r\n Our work revealed a complex metabolic response landscape of human liver transcriptome and provided a novel resource to understand transcriptome dynamics of human liver in response to physiologically relevant metabolic stimuli ( Impact and implications Direct knowledge of the human liver transcriptome is currently very limited hindering the overall understanding of human liver pathophysiology. We combined a liver-specific humanized mouse model and long read direct RNA sequencing technology to establish a de novo annotation of the human liver transcriptome and identified a multitude of regulated metabolic pathways that were otherwise invisible using conventional technologies. The extensive regulatory information of human genes we provided would allow basic scientists to infer the disease relevance of their genes of interest and physician scientists to better pinpoint the changes in metabolic networks underlying a specific pathophysiology.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNIS2+TM as a screening tool to optimize patient selection in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis clinical trials. \r\nWhile the use of FIB-4 alone did not lead to a significant improvement of the screening process, selecting patients using NIS2+ ™, a recently developed optimization of the NIS4® technology for the detection of at-risk MASH, showed improved performances by simultaneously reducing LBFRs and the overall cost of the trial, keeping a manageable number of patients needed to screen, without generating any bias in included patients' characteristics. This makes NIS2+ ™ an accurate and reliable screening tool for improving the recruitment of patients in future MASH clinical trials, and would lead to increased patient comfort and security, ensuring timely and cost-efficient completion of those trials.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Neurogastroenterol Motil\r\n    Esophageal Motility Abnormalities in Lung Transplant Recipients With Esophageal Acid Reflux Are Different From Matched Controls. \r\nThe strongest correlation with AET after LT was found to be esophageal peristaltic vigor.

There is large uncertainty in HDV prevalence. The implementation of reflex testing would improve estimates, while also allowing earlier linkage to care for HDV-RNA-positive individuals. The logistical and economic burden of reflex testing on the health system would be limited, as it would only screen HBsAg+ cases. Impact and implications There is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the prevalence of HDV among people living with HBV at the population level. This study aimed to better understand the burden in 25 countries and territories, to refine techniques that can be used in future analyses. We found a lower prevalence in the majority of places studied than had been previously reported. These data can help inform policy makers on the need to screen people living with HBV to find those coinfected with HDV and at high risk for progression, while also highlighting the pitfalls that other researchers have often fallen into.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Neurogastroenterol Motil\r\n    The Prevalence and Characteristics of Symptomatic Uncomplicated Diverticular Disease Among Asian Patients With Unexplained Abdominal Symptoms.\r\nIt is important to recognize that patients with SUDD account for as high as 31% of outpatients with unexplained abdominal symptoms;  these patients have diarrhea and a low QOL.
