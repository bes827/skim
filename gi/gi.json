Choice of testing should be guided by index of suspicion.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    BENEFITS OF PROKINETICS, GASTROPARESIS DIET, OR NEUROMODULATORS ALONE OR IN COMBINATION FOR SYMPTOMS OF GASTROPARESIS.\r\n Initiating prokinetics as solo new therapy had little benefit for patients with symptoms of gastroparesis. Neuromodulators as the only new therapy decreased symptoms other than nausea and vomiting, especially with non-delayed gastric emptying. Adding gastroparesis diets or neuromodulators to prokinetics offered relief, suggesting that combination therapies may be more useful in managing these patients. (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02022826).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEffect of real-time computer-aided polyp detection system (ENDO-AID) on adenoma detection in endoscopists-in-training: a randomized trial.\r\nAmong endoscopists-in-training, the use of CADe during colonoscopies was associated with increased overall ADR.

In patients with NAFLD without advanced fibrosis, HRQoL is independently associated with non-liver comorbidities but not LS. Multi-disciplinary management is therefore required in NAFLD, irrespective of fibrosis severity.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHistological activity in inflammatory bowel disease and risk of serious infections: A nationwide study.\r\n Histological inflammation of IBD was an independent risk factor of serious infections, including sepsis, suggesting that achieving histological remission may reduce infections in IBD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    An NFATc1/SMAD3/cJUN complex restricted to SMAD4-deficient pancreatic cancer guides rational therapies.\r\n Our results suggest that PDAC characterized by SMAD4 deficiency and oncogenic NFATc1/SMAD3/cJUN complex formation exposes sensitivity to a MEKi/gemcitabine combination therapy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    A Composite Score of Physiomechanical Esophageal Function Using Functional Lumen Imaging Probe Panometry in Eosinophilic Esophagitis.\r\nThis composite score of FLIP Panometry metrics, the C2D2 score, may facilitate characterizing physiomechanical function in EoE and serve as an objective outcome measure.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImpact of Endoscopic Ultrasound in Unresectable Perihilar Cholangiocarcinoma patients in Liver Transplantation work-up.\r\nOur current EUS screening for the detection of malignant LN in patients with pCCA eligible for LT shows a limited but clinically important yield. EUS with systematic screening of al LN stations, both regional and non-regional and sampling of 'suspicious' lymph nodes according to defined and set criteria could potentially increase this yield.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nUn-tutored training pathway to achieve competence in esophago-gastric endoscopic submucosal dissection in a Western center.\r\nUn-tutored training for esophago-gastric ESD is feasible and allows endoscopists, experienced in therapeutic endoscopy, to achieve the required standards towards competency.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    IL-20 controls resolution of experimental colitis by regulating epithelial IFN/STAT2 signalling.\r\n IL-20 controls colitis and mucosal healing by interfering with the IFN/STAT2 death signalling pathway in IECs.

These observations may harbor broad implications for HCC, including possible clinical exploitation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFurther decompensation in cirrhosis. Results of a large multicenter cohort study supporting Baveno VII statements.\r\n In cirrhosis, further decompensation occurs in approximately 60% of patients, significantly increases mortality, and should be considered a more advanced stage of decompensated cirrhosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe chemokine CXCL14 is a novel early prognostic biomarker for poor outcome in acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure.\r\nWe find in two independent cohorts of APAP overdose patients that circulating CXCL14 concentration is a novel early prognostic biomarker for poor outcome which may aid in guiding decisions regarding patient management. Moreover, our findings reveal that CXCL14 performs best when measured soon after patient presentation to the clinic, highlighting its importance for early warning of poor prognosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Balance of Gata3 and Ramp2 in hepatocytes regulates hepatic vascular reconstitution in postoperative liver regeneration.\r\nThe balance of Gata3 and Ramp2 in hepatocytes regulated the proliferation of LSECs and hepatic revascularization via shifting PEDF to VEGFA, which provided potential targets for the prevention and treatment of PHLF. Impact and implications In this study, we revealed a novel mechanism that the balance of Gata3 and Ramp2 in hepatocyte regulated hepatic vascular reconstitution via shifting PEDF to VEGFA during hepatectomy- or ALLPS-induced liver regeneration. We also identified serum PEDF/VEGFA index (SPVI) as a potential predictor for post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) in patients who underwent hepatectomy. This study will provide a better understanding on how hepatocytes contribute to liver regeneration and new targets for the prevention and treatment of PHLF.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCircadian dysfunction induces NAFLD-related human liver cancer in a mouse model.\r\n Chronic circadian dysfunction is an independent carcinogen to human hepatocytes. Mice with humanized livers provide a powerful preclinical model for studying the impact of the necrotic-inflammatory liver environment and neuroendocrine circadian dysfunction in hepatocarcinogenesis and anti-HCC therapy. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS-2  Human epidemiological studies have linked chronic circadian dysfunction to increased HCC risk, but direct evidence that circadian dysfunction is a human carcinogen has not been established. Here we show that circadian dysfunction induces nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-related carcinogenesis from human hepatocytes in a murine humanized liver model following the same molecular and pathologic pathways observed in human patients. The gene expression signatures of humanized HCC transcriptomes from circadian disrupted mice closely match those of human HCC with the poorest prognostic outcomes, while those from stably circadian entrained mice match those from human HCC with the best prognostic outcomes. Our studies open a new model for defining to the mechanism of NASH-related HCC and highlight the importance of circadian biology in HCC prevention and treatment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatocellular carcinoma risk in Sub-Saharan African and Afro-Surinamese individuals with chronic hepatitis B living in Europe.\r\nThis unique international multicenter cohort of SSA and AS individuals with CHB showed a 5 and 10 year cumulative HCC risk of 1% and 2.4%. The risk of HCC was negligible for individuals without advanced fibrosis at baseline, and among individuals with low baseline (m)PAGE-B scores. These findings can be used to guide HCC surveillance strategies. Impact and implications Sub-Sahara African ethnicity has been associated with a higher risk of hepatocellular carcinoma among individuals with chronic hepatitis B. In this international multicenter cohort study of sub- Saharan African and Afro-Surinamese individuals living with chronic hepatitis B in Europe, we found a 5 and 10 year cumulative incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma of 1% and 2.4%. The risk was negligible among individuals without advanced fibrosis and a low baseline (m)PAGE-B score. These findings can be used to guide HCC surveillance strategies in this population.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSIRT5 rs12216101 T>G variant is associated with liver damage and mitochondrial dysfunction in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\r\nSIRT5 rs12216101 T>G variant, heightening SIRT5 activity, is associated with liver damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress in NAFLD patients. Impact and implications In this study we discovered that the SIRT5 rs12216101 T>G variant is associated with higher disease severity in NAFLD patients. This risk variant determines SIRT5 gain-of-function, enhancing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and thus leading to oxidative stress. SIRT5 may represent a novel disease modulator in NAFLD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the publisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Editorial: Can liver fat quantification stratify cardiovascular risk in type 2 diabetes?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: HBsAg seroclearance after pegylated interferon treatment-The beginning of the end.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Noninvasive tests for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease: A refinement of the Nash-FibroTest for type 2 diabetes mellitus.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: PPIs and gastric cancer-Are we dealing with a carcinogen?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: The role of point-of-care echocardiography for assessing cirrhotic cardiomyopathy and predicting clinical outcomes in acute-on-chronic liver failure with severe sepsis.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Quantifying Endoscopic Activity in Ulcerative Colitis: Innovation, Powered by AI.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    Getting off tract: contributions of intraorgan microbiota to cancer in extraintestinal organs.\r\nThese habitats are challenging to sample, and their low microbial biomass among large amounts of host tissue can make study challenging. Nevertheless, recent findings have shown that many extraintestinal organs that are intimately linked to the gut harbour stable microbiomes, which are colonised from the gut in selective manners and have highlighted not just the influence of the bacteriome but that of the mycobiome and virome on oncogenesis and health.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Adeno-associated viruses for gene therapy - clinical implications and liver related complications, a guide for hepatologists.\r\nThe liver community is increasingly being asked to support liver-directed gene therapy to mitigate potential liver associated harm. In this review, we focus on AAV-vector based gene therapy shedding light on this promising technique, its remarkable success in hemophilia gene therapy with a special focus on the hepatic complications and their management in daily clinical practice.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous\r\nmisc publications eg case reports, tools of the trade, images of the month, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Gastroenterol\r\n    Calendar of Courses, Symposiums and Conferences.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRandomized Controlled Trials for Helicobacter pylori Infection: What We Should Compare.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nResponse to Andrew et al.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nResponse to Fahey et al.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Role of Intestinal Ultrasound During Pregnancy in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThinking of the Long Puzzling Issue of Several Suboptimal Treatments of Helicobacter pylori Infection.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopy\r\n    A neuroendocrine tumor improper for ligation with suction was resected en bloc by underwater endoscopic submucosal dissection.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nA unique case of well-differentiated gastric-type adenocarcinoma coexisting with a gastric adenocarcinoma of the fundic gland in a Helicobacter pylori-uninfected stomach.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nAn unexpected gastric submucosal mass-like lesion.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nConvergence of endobariatrics and endohepatology for evaluation and treatment of obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nDetection of Barrett's dysplasia using forceps biopsies vs. wide-area transepithelial sampling.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopy E-Videos - recently published.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRe: A novel salvage method to recapture the maldeployed distal flange of a lumen-apposing metal stent.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSurfing the AI wave: Insights and challenges.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    Cryotherapy for treatment of large non-lifting polyp at rectal anastomosis.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    Advancing with cancer immunotherapeutics: CD29+ regulatory T cell antagonism.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nBeyond a liver-gut focus: the evolution of gastroenterology and hepatology in challenging the obesity and steatotic liver disease paradigm.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCD39 deletion in TCR-engineered T cells enhances antitumour immunity.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDietary fibre (and animal products) modulate the association between tryptophan intake, gut microbiota and type 2 diabetes: but how?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGORD and GLP-1 receptor agonists: an emerging concern for gastroenterologists.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMore than shots in the dark: improving patient stratification to move closer to personalised therapies in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPleiotropic role of NOTUM in colorectal cancer.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    Letter to the Editor: Cautious interpretation of the association between finite treatment and better prognosis in initially HBeAg-negative hepatitis B patients with cirrhosis.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLetter to the Editor: Recognizing the new nomenclature requires a comprehensive analysis of the prevalence, severity, and long-term outlook for SLD and subclassifications.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReply: \"How to define the futile outcome in patients undergoing surgery for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma\".\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReply: Cautious interpretation of the association between finite treatment and better prognosis in initially HBeAg-negative hepatitis B patients with cirrhosis.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReply: Recognizing the new nomenclature requires a comprehensive analysis of the prevalence severity, and long-term outlook for SLD and subclassifications.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetters&Replies\r\nLetters to the editors and authors’ replies\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Editorial: Can liver fat quantification stratify cardiovascular risk in type 2 diabetes?

This Expert Commentary incorporates important as well as recently published studies in this field, and it reflects the experiences of the authors who are experienced endoscopists with expertise in the field of artificial intelligence and colorectal polyps.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    AASLD practice guidance on risk stratification and management of portal hypertension and varices in cirrhosis.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nValidation of AGA clinical care pathway and AASLD practice guidance for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in a prospective cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes.\r\n Validation of the AGA clinical pathway in a prospectively recruited cohort with T2DM revealed a low false negative rate and avoided specialty referral in a large percentage of patients. The AASLD pathway with FIB-4 + ELF resulted in a high rate of specialty referral, which improved with utilization of higher ELF cut-points and may serve as an alternative for primary care and endocrinology clinics without access to VCTE.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    EASL-ERN position paper on liver involvement in patients with Fontan-type circulation.\r\nHowever, based on the increasing number of adult Fontan patients and recent research interest, the European Association for The Study of the Liver and the European Reference Network on Rare Liver Diseases thought a position paper timely. The aims of the current paper are: (1) to provide a clear definition and description of FALD, including clinical, analytical, radiological, haemodynamic, and histological features;  (2) to facilitate guidance for staging the liver disease;  and (3) to provide evidence- and experience-based recommendations for the management of different clinical scenarios.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeta-analysis\r\nmeta-analyses and systematic reviews\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Systematic review: Glycomics as diagnostic markers for hepatocellular carcinoma.\r\nAlterations in serum N-glycomics, characterised by increased levels of fucosylation and branching, have potential as diagnostic biomarkers for HCC.

Increased comorbidity, large hospital size, public insurance, and urban teaching hospitals were associated with higher rates of CDI. CDI was associated with increased mortality in hospitalized patients with IBD. Continued vigilance, infection control, and treatment of CDI can help continue the trend of declining infection rates.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRetrospective cohort study: Effect of age as a barrier to diagnosis of eosinophilic oesophagitis.\r\nElderly patients with EoE have <50% the odds of oesophageal biopsies. There were no significant differences between elderly and non-elderly EoE patients, although endoscopic features helped discriminate the two groups. Our findings suggest that older age represents a barrier to EoE diagnosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAm J Gastroenterol\r\n    EFFECT OF GLUCAGON-LIKE PEPTIDE-1 RECEPTOR AGONISTS ON BOWEL PREPARATION FOR COLONOSCOPY.\r\n The use of GLP-1RAs was associated with a statistically significantly lower quality of bowel preparation, with additional clinical significance given a notable difference in the need for a repeat colonoscopy. It will be essential to understand the cumulative effect of medications that may delay gastric emptying on the quality of bowel preparation to better understand the appropriate measures and counseling that need to be taken before undergoing outpatient colonoscopies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease facilitates hepatitis B surface antigen seroclearance and seroconversion.\r\nIn untreated HBeAg-negative CHB patients, concurrent MASLD is associated with higher rates of HBsAg seroclearance and seroconversion.

FMO2 impairs lipogenesis in HFD or CDAHFD-induced steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis by directly binding to SREBP1 and preventing its organelle translocation and subsequent activation. FMO2 thus is a promising molecule for targeting the activation of SREBP1 and for the treatment of NAFL/NASH.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImpact of radiological response and pattern of progression in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma treated by atezolizumab- bevacizumab.\r\nRECIST 1.1 and mRECIST criteria predict OS with more responders identified by mRECIST and appearance of new extrahepatic lesion or vascular invasion was associated with a poor prognosis.

It mostly consists in mild and rapidly resolving episodes of renal dysfunction and it is not associated with tubular kidney injury. Patients with ongoing infections appear to be the only ones at higher risk of AKI. Impact and implications Nephrotoxicity due to intravenous iodinated contrast media (ICM) in patients with cirrhosis is still a debated issue, as the available evidence is limited and based on very heterogeneous studies, often conducted on small and retrospective cohorts. In this prospective three-cohort study we found that intravenous administration of ICM was associated with a low risk of AKI, similar to that of the general population and to that of patients with cirrhosis unexposed to ICM. Patients with ongoing infections were the only to have a significantly increased risk of CI-AKI. Therefore, the actual recommendations of performing contrast imaging studies cautiously in cirrhosis do not seem to be reasonable anymore, with the exception of infected patients, which have a significantly higher risk of CI-AKI.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHigher TP53BP2 expression is associated with HBsAg loss in peginterferon-alpha-treated patients with chronic hepatitis B.\r\n Rs7519753 C allele is associated with an increased probability of serum HBsAg loss in patients with CHB post-Peg-IFNa treatment and elevated hepatic TP53BP2 expression. TP53BP2 enhances the response of the hepatocyte to IFN-a by suppressing SOCS2 expression. Impact and implications Chronic Hepatitis B (CHB) remains a global public health issue. Although current antiviral therapies are more effective in halting disease progression, only a few patients achieve functional cure for hepatitis B with HBsAg loss, highlighting the urgent need for a cure for CHB. This study revealed that the SNP rs7519753 C allele, which is associated with high expression of hepatic TP53BP2, significantly increases the likelihood of serum HBsAg loss in CHB patients undergoing Peg-IFNa therapy. This finding not only provides an exciting predictor for HBsAg loss but identifies a potential therapeutic target for Peg-IFNa treatment. We believe our results are of great interest to a wide range of stakeholders, including patients and patient organizations, the medical community, academia, the life science industry, and the general public.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImmune responses and clinical outcomes after COVID-19 vaccination in patients with liver disease and in liver transplant recipients.\r\n After three COVID-19 vaccines, patients with liver disease generally develop robust antibody and T cell responses to vaccination and have mild COVID-19. However, LTR have sustained no/low antibody titres and appear most vulnerable to severe disease. Impact and implications Standardised assessments of the immune response to different COVID-19 vaccines in patients liver disease are lacking. We performed antibody and T cell assays at multiple timepoints following up to three vaccine doses in a large cohort of patients with a range of liver conditions. Overall, the three most widely available vaccine platforms were immunogenic and appeared to protect against severe breakthrough COVID-19. This will provide reassurance to patients with chronic liver disease who were deemed at high risk of severe COVID-19 during the pre-vaccination era, however, liver transplant recipients had the lowest antibody titres and remained vulnerable to severe breakthrough infection. We also characterise the immune response to multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants and describe the interaction between disease type, severity, and vaccine platform. These insights may prove useful in the event of future viral infections which also require rapid vaccine development and delivery to liver patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPredicting survival in patients with 'non-high-risk' acute variceal bleeding receiving ß-blockers+ligation to prevent re-bleeding.\r\n The majority of 'non-high-risk' patients with AVB have an excellent outcome, if treated according to current recommendations. However, about one fifth of patients, i.e., those with CTP =8 and/or high creatinine levels or hyponatremia, have a considerable risk of death within 1 year of the index bleed. Future clinical trials should investigate whether elective TIPS placement reduces mortality in these patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the publisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Blue Notes.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCommon Instances of Low-value Care in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.\r\nThis review is meant to bring attention to value-based care in IBD and provide guidance to treating practitioners.

The magnitude of the increased MACE risk was not different by IMID type. These results require confirmation in larger prospective studies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndosc Int Open\r\n    Full-thickness resection device for management of lesions involving the appendiceal orifice: Systematic review and meta-analysis.\r\nHowever, appendicitis post-resection occurs in a non-trivial number of patients and the R0 resection rate in appendiceal lesions is only 72%. Therefore, caution should be employed in the use of this technique, considering the relative risks of surgical intervention in each patient.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nUnderwater versus conventional endoscopic mucosal resection for colorectal lesions: An updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.\r\nUEMR is a promising effective technique for removal of colorectal lesions. The most contemporary literature indicates that it improves en bloc resection rate without increasing procedure time, recurrence, or AEs (PROSPERO ID CRD42022374935).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    Fully versus Partially-Covered Self-Expandable Metal Stents for palliation of distal malignant biliary obstruction: a meta-analysis.\r\nDespite considerable heterogeneity and small standardized differences, PC-SEMS consistently exhibited longer TRBO than FC-SEMS across analyses, without any other differences in AEs rates, potentially proposing PC-SEMS as standard comparator and TRBO as primary outcome for future randomized studies on dMBO (CRD42023393965).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    Changing prevalence of chronic hepatitis B virus infection in China between 1973 and 2021: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of 3740 studies and 231 million people.\r\nChina has experienced remarkable decreases in HBV infection over the last four decades, but variations in HBsAg prevalence persist in subpopulations. Ongoing prevention of HBV transmission is needed to meet HBV elimination targets by 2030.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    Letter to the Editor: Acute rejection after liver transplantation with machine perfusion versus static cold storage: A systematic review and meta-analysis.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReply: Acute rejection after liver transplantation with machine perfusion versus static cold storage: A systematic review and meta-analysis.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Obeticholic acid as a second-line treatment for low phospholipid-associated cholelithiasis syndrome.\r\nThese preliminary observations suggest that OCA may have the potential to effectively treat LPAC syndrome in patients with inadequate response or intolerance to UDCA. Larger studies are needed to confirm these data.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAm J Gastroenterol\r\n    Clinical outcomes after endoscopic management of low-risk and high-risk T1a esophageal adenocarcinoma: A multicenter study.\r\n High-risk T1a EAC patients undergoing successful EET had a substantially higher rate of extra-esophageal metastases compared to low-risk T1a EAC on long term follow-up. These data should be factored into discussions with patients while selecting treatment approaches. Additional prospective data in this area are critical.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEffectiveness and Safety of Antiobesity Medications in Patients With Obesity and Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\n AOM use in patients with IBD demonstrated similar effectiveness and safety when compared with that observed in the non-IBD population.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGlobal, regional, and national burden of gastric cancer in adolescents and young adults, 1990-2019: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019.\r\nIn the past 30 years, although the total number of new cases of GCAYA has increased with population growth, the ASIR and overall disease burden have shown a decreasing trend. This indicates progress in screening, diagnosis, treatment, education, and awareness efforts. However, the distribution of this disease remains uneven in terms of gender, age, development level, region, and country. To address these challenges, global health authorities should take appropriate measures such as optimizing screening programs, strengthening awareness and screening efforts for males, enhancing prevention and control among the 35-39 age group, improving infrastructure and healthcare resources in developing countries, promoting international cooperation, and implementing tailored measures.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMaternal and Neonatal Outcomes in Vedolizumab and Ustekinumab Exposed Pregnancies: Results from the PIANO registry.\r\n This analysis of UST and VDZ exposure during pregnancy suggests no increase in complications compared to TNFs, immunomodulators and combination TNFs/immunomodulators.

Impact and implications The risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in subjects with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) seems to be lower compared to other aetiologies of chronic liver disease. Yet, solid data for this specific patient group remains elusive, given that most of the existing evidence comes from small, single-centre studies. In our study, we found that HCC incidence in AIH patients is low even after the onset of cirrhosis. Additionally, factors such as advanced age, obesity, cirrhosis, alcohol consumption, and the presence of the AIH/PSC variant syndrome at the time of AIH diagnosis are linked to a higher risk of HCC. Based on these findings, there seems to be merit in adopting a specialized HCC monitoring program for AIH patients, taking into account their individual risk factors.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTherapeutic vaccination with lentiviral vector in HBV-persistent mice and two inactive HBsAg carriers. \r\nIn the two inactive HBsAg carrier patients, vaccination with LV-LHBs induced a considerable increase in the number of peripheral LHBs-specific T cells in one patient, and a weak but detectable response in the other, accompanied by a sustained reduction of HBsAg (-0.31 log10 IU/ml and -0.46 log10 IU/ml, respectively) from baseline to nadir.
