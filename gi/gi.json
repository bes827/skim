While research gaps remain, we anticipate that these recommendations will lead to improvements in CF outcomes through earlier detection and increased evidence-based approaches to monitoring and treatment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeta-analysis\r\nmeta-analyses and systematic reviews\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Clinical trial: predictive factors for response to gut-directed hypnotherapy for refractory irritable bowel syndrome, a post hoc analysis.\r\nThese data suggest that patients with a higher burden of gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms are most likely to benefit from gut-specific behavioural intervention for refractory IBS. Clinical assessment of gastrointestinal, somatic and psychological symptom profiles may play a role in selecting patients for gut-directed hypnotherapy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTreatment rates and factors associated with direct-acting antiviral therapy for insured patients with hepatitis C-related hepatocellular carcinoma - A real-world nationwide study.\r\n DAA treatment remains underutilised in insured patients with HCV-related HCC;  fewer than one in four patients received treatment. Seeing a specialist and having decompensated cirrhosis were predictors for DAA treatment;  additional efforts are needed to increase awareness of HCV treatment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAm J Gastroenterol\r\n    Antibiotics with or without Rifaximin for acute hepatic Encephalopathy in critically ill patients with cirrhosis: A double-blind, randomized controlled (ARiE) trial.\r\n Reversal of overt HE in those on antibiotics was comparable to those on antibiotics+rifaximin.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCarvedilol plus NUCs for compensated HBV-cirrhosis patients under virological suppression: a randomised, open-label trial.\r\nThe overall results did not show statistically significant differences between the added carvedilol strategy and NUCs monotherapy in preventing EVs progression in virologically suppressed HBV-cirrhosis patients. However, the carvedilol-added approach might offer improved outcomes specifically for patients with medium EVs (NCT03736265).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOutcomes of a Three-Year Quality Improvement Study to Improve Advance Care Planning in Patients with Decompensated Cirrhosis.\r\nACP initiatives are feasible and may reduce healthcare utilization among decedents requesting less aggressive care.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPredictors of Respiratory Failure Development in A Multi-Center Cohort of Inpatients with Cirrhosis.\r\nIn a multi-center inpatient cirrhosis study of patients not exposed to terlipressin, 15% patients developed RF. RF risk was highest in those admitted with AKI, had GI bleeding on admission and those who developed nosocomial infections, and other organ failures, or received albumin during their hospital course. Careful volume monitoring and preventing nosocomial respiratory infections, renal or circulatory failures could reduce this risk.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Buprenorphine versus diclofenac for pain relief in acute pancreatitis: A double-blinded randomized-controlled trial.\r\nCompared to diclofenac, buprenorphine appears to be more effective and equally safe for pain management in AP patients, even in the sub-cohort of moderately severe or severe pancreatitis (Trial Registration\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEffect of real-time computer-aided polyp detection system (ENDO-AID) on adenoma detection in endoscopists-in-training: a randomized trial.\r\nAmong endoscopists-in-training, the use of CADe during colonoscopies was associated with increased overall ADR. (ClinicalTrials.gov  NCT04838951).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMetoclopramide Nasal Spray in Women with Symptomatic Diabetic Gastroparesis: A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Phase 3 Study.\r\nAlthough the primary endpoint was not met using al enrolled patients, treatment with MNS provided significant relief for women with moderate to severe diabetic gastroparesis symptoms. MNS was well tolerated and demonstrated a similar safety profile to placebo.  identifier  NCT02025725.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndosc Int Open\r\n    A 3D-printed pedal fixator for connecting different pedal-operated tools reduces the number of mistakes during endoscopic submucosal dissection.\r\nIPEFIX is a simple device to connect different pedals during endoscopic procedures. It helps to reduce the numbers of foot mistakes during ESD and improves operator comfort.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nBronchoscopy masks mitigate aerosols during upper gastrointestinal endoscopies.\r\nBronchoscopy masks or similar are a simple, low-cost mitigation technique that can be used during outbreaks of respiratory diseases such as COVID-19 to improve safety and reduce fallow times.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCosts of purchase, maintenance, microbiological control, and reprocessing of a reusable duodenoscope.\r\nTheoretical costs were higher than observed costs, showing that the theoretical approach is not sufficient. Hypotheses to explain the difference between the two approaches include failing to measure some costs in the survey and challenges in guideline implementation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLarge serrated polyps indicate a greater risk of advanced metachronous colorectal neoplasia than high-grade adenomas.\r\nThe risk for TMAN was higher for patients with SLs = 10 mm than with HGD or SLs < 10 mm. This risk should be considered when planning surveillance intervals for patients diagnosed with large SLs.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNext-generation sequencing of pancreatic cyst wall specimens obtained using micro-forceps for improving diagnostic accuracy.\r\nNGS data correlate well with histology and may aid in diagnosis and risk stratification of pancreatic cysts. Cyst wall biopsy performs well in diagnosing cysts but was inadequate in five of 24 patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPredicting procedure duration of colorectal endoscopic submucosal dissection at Western endoscopy centers.\r\nWe provided two useful tools for predicting colorectal ESD duration at Western centers. Further improvements and validations are encouraged with potential local adaptation to optimize time planning.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSettings of a novel electrosurgical generator to enable efficient and safe submucosal endoscopic procedures.\r\nConMed Beamer ESU settings generated from this study were proven safe and effective in a prospective cohort of patients who underwent submucosal endoscopic procedures. This novel ESU can be added to the armamentarium of ESD capable generators.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopy\r\n    Differences in treatment of stage I colorectal cancers: a population-based study of colorectal cancers detected within and outside of a screening program.\r\nT1 stage I screen-detected CRCs were also more likely to undergo less invasive treatment than non-screen-detected CRCs, adjusted for risk factors such as LVI and tumor differentiation. Future research should investigate whether the choice of local excision was related to unidentified cancer-related factors or the expertise of the endoscopists.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLinked-Color Imaging versus High-definition White light endoscopy for evaluation of post-polypectomy scars of non-pedunculated lesions. LCI-Scar Study.\r\ns.

This review evaluates each of these technologies and their role in providing alternatives to testing in animals.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEtiology-independent activation of the LTß-LTßR-RELB axis drives aggressiveness and predicts poor prognosis in Hepatocellular carcinoma.\r\nThis study demonstrates a prognostically relevant, etiology-independent and cross-species consistent activation of a LTß/LTßR/RELB axis in hepatocarcinogenesis. These observations may harbor broad implications for HCC, including possible clinical exploitation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFurther decompensation in cirrhosis. Results of a large multicenter cohort study supporting Baveno VII statements.\r\n In cirrhosis, further decompensation occurs in approximately 60% of patients, significantly increases mortality, and should be considered a more advanced stage of decompensated cirrhosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver disease in germline mutations of telomere-related genes: Prevalence, clinical, radiological, pathological features, outcome, and risk factors.\r\nTRG mutations significantly increase the risk of developing liver disease. Although symptoms may be mild they may be associated with severe disease. PSVD and cirrhosis were the most frequent lesions suggesting that the mechanism of action is multifactorial.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRate and durability of clearance of hepatitis B surface antigen in Alaska Native persons with long-term hepatitis B virus infection: 1982-2019.\r\nOf patients with chronic HBV monoinfection, 0.82% of people per year achieved a functional cure. HBsAg seroclearance was durable for treated and non-treated patients and lasted on average over 13 years without seroreversion. The findings and conclusions in this report are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official positions of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Balance of Gata3 and Ramp2 in hepatocytes regulates hepatic vascular reconstitution in postoperative liver regeneration.\r\nThe balance of Gata3 and Ramp2 in hepatocytes regulated the proliferation of LSECs and hepatic revascularization via shifting PEDF to VEGFA, which provided potential targets for the prevention and treatment of PHLF. Impact and implications In this study, we revealed a novel mechanism that the balance of Gata3 and Ramp2 in hepatocyte regulated hepatic vascular reconstitution via shifting PEDF to VEGFA during hepatectomy- or ALLPS-induced liver regeneration. We also identified serum PEDF/VEGFA index (SPVI) as a potential predictor for post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) in patients who underwent hepatectomy. This study will provide a better understanding on how hepatocytes contribute to liver regeneration and new targets for the prevention and treatment of PHLF.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInhibition of the Renal Apical Sodium Dependent Bile Acid Transporter Prevents Cholemic Nephropathy in Mice with Obstructive Cholestasis.\r\nBA enrichment in proximal TEC followed by oxidative stress and cell death is an early key event in CN. Inhibiting renal ASBT and consequently BA enrichment in TEC prevents CN and systemically decreases BA concentrations. Impact and implications Cholemic nephropathy (CN) is a severe complication of cholestasis with an unmet clinical need for therapy. We demonstrate that CN is triggered by the renal accumulation of bile acids (BA)- that are considerably increased in the systemic blood. Specifically, the proximal tubular epithelial cells (TEC) of the kidney take up BA via the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT). We developed a therapeutic compound that blocks ASBT in the kidneys, prevents BA overload in TEC, and almost completely abolished al disease hallmarks in a CN mouse model. Renal ASBT inhibition represents a potential therapeutic strategy for CN patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJAK1 promotes HDV replication and is a potential target for antiviral therapy.\r\nTaken together, we uncovered JAK1 as a key host factor for HDV replication and a potential target for new antiviral treatment. Impact and implications Chronic hepatitis D is the most aggressive form of chronic viral hepatitis with no curative treatment. New therapeutic strategies based on host targeting agents are urgently needed. Here, using loss-of-function strategies, we uncover an unexpected interaction between JAK1, a major actor of the innate antiviral response, and HDV infection. We demonstrated that JAK1 kinase activity is crucial for both the phosphorylation of the delta antigen and the replication of the virus. By demonstrating the antiviral potential of several FDA-approved JAK1 inhibitors, our results could pave the way to the development of innovative therapeutic strategies to tackle this global health threat.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the publisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Assessing risk of index serrated polyps.\r\nThe most recent US Multi Society Task Force (USMSTF) for Colorectal Cancer (CRC) post-polypectomy guidelines recommend surveillance intervals for sessile serrated lesions (SSLs) based on size, dysplasia, and number of index polyps. 1 Large (>1 cm) hyperplastic polyps (HPs), which previously had a 10 year follow-up recommendation, now have a 3-5 year interval, 2 However, most of the serrated polyp recommendations were based on low quality evidence, underscoring the need for more data.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Evolving Landscape of Colorectal Cancer Screening and Colonoscopy Practice: Insights from the Japan Polyp Study.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Toward quantification of H. pylori-associated gastric cancer risk: Further evidence supporting development of population-based strategies for H. pylori eradication.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    Getting off tract: contributions of intraorgan microbiota to cancer in extraintestinal organs.\r\nThese habitats are challenging to sample, and their low microbial biomass among large amounts of host tissue can make study challenging. Nevertheless, recent findings have shown that many extraintestinal organs that are intimately linked to the gut harbour stable microbiomes, which are colonised from the gut in selective manners and have highlighted not just the influence of the bacteriome but that of the mycobiome and virome on oncogenesis and health.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Inflammatory bowel disease and primary sclerosing cholangitis: One disease or two?\r\nImplications for the management of the two diseases together are also discussed.

Moreover, our findings reveal that CXCL14 performs best when measured soon after patient presentation to the clinic, highlighting its importance for early warning of poor prognosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Balance of Gata3 and Ramp2 in hepatocytes regulates hepatic vascular reconstitution in postoperative liver regeneration.\r\nThe balance of Gata3 and Ramp2 in hepatocytes regulated the proliferation of LSECs and hepatic revascularization via shifting PEDF to VEGFA, which provided potential targets for the prevention and treatment of PHLF. Impact and implications In this study, we revealed a novel mechanism that the balance of Gata3 and Ramp2 in hepatocyte regulated hepatic vascular reconstitution via shifting PEDF to VEGFA during hepatectomy- or ALLPS-induced liver regeneration. We also identified serum PEDF/VEGFA index (SPVI) as a potential predictor for post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) in patients who underwent hepatectomy. This study will provide a better understanding on how hepatocytes contribute to liver regeneration and new targets for the prevention and treatment of PHLF.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCircadian dysfunction induces NAFLD-related human liver cancer in a mouse model.\r\n Chronic circadian dysfunction is an independent carcinogen to human hepatocytes. Mice with humanized livers provide a powerful preclinical model for studying the impact of the necrotic-inflammatory liver environment and neuroendocrine circadian dysfunction in hepatocarcinogenesis and anti-HCC therapy. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS-2  Human epidemiological studies have linked chronic circadian dysfunction to increased HCC risk, but direct evidence that circadian dysfunction is a human carcinogen has not been established. Here we show that circadian dysfunction induces nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-related carcinogenesis from human hepatocytes in a murine humanized liver model following the same molecular and pathologic pathways observed in human patients. The gene expression signatures of humanized HCC transcriptomes from circadian disrupted mice closely match those of human HCC with the poorest prognostic outcomes, while those from stably circadian entrained mice match those from human HCC with the best prognostic outcomes. Our studies open a new model for defining to the mechanism of NASH-related HCC and highlight the importance of circadian biology in HCC prevention and treatment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatocellular carcinoma risk in Sub-Saharan African and Afro-Surinamese individuals with chronic hepatitis B living in Europe.\r\nThis unique international multicenter cohort of SSA and AS individuals with CHB showed a 5 and 10 year cumulative HCC risk of 1% and 2.4%. The risk of HCC was negligible for individuals without advanced fibrosis at baseline, and among individuals with low baseline (m)PAGE-B scores. These findings can be used to guide HCC surveillance strategies. Impact and implications Sub-Sahara African ethnicity has been associated with a higher risk of hepatocellular carcinoma among individuals with chronic hepatitis B. In this international multicenter cohort study of sub- Saharan African and Afro-Surinamese individuals living with chronic hepatitis B in Europe, we found a 5 and 10 year cumulative incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma of 1% and 2.4%. The risk was negligible among individuals without advanced fibrosis and a low baseline (m)PAGE-B score. These findings can be used to guide HCC surveillance strategies in this population.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSIRT5 rs12216101 T>G variant is associated with liver damage and mitochondrial dysfunction in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\r\nSIRT5 rs12216101 T>G variant, heightening SIRT5 activity, is associated with liver damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress in NAFLD patients. Impact and implications In this study we discovered that the SIRT5 rs12216101 T>G variant is associated with higher disease severity in NAFLD patients. This risk variant determines SIRT5 gain-of-function, enhancing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and thus leading to oxidative stress. SIRT5 may represent a novel disease modulator in NAFLD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the publisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Editorial: Can liver fat quantification stratify cardiovascular risk in type 2 diabetes?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: HBsAg seroclearance after pegylated interferon treatment-The beginning of the end.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Noninvasive tests for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease: A refinement of the Nash-FibroTest for type 2 diabetes mellitus.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: PPIs and gastric cancer-Are we dealing with a carcinogen?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: The role of point-of-care echocardiography for assessing cirrhotic cardiomyopathy and predicting clinical outcomes in acute-on-chronic liver failure with severe sepsis.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Quantifying Endoscopic Activity in Ulcerative Colitis: Innovation, Powered by AI.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    Getting off tract: contributions of intraorgan microbiota to cancer in extraintestinal organs.\r\nThese habitats are challenging to sample, and their low microbial biomass among large amounts of host tissue can make study challenging.

The AASLD pathway with FIB-4 + ELF resulted in a high rate of specialty referral, which improved with utilization of higher ELF cut-points and may serve as an alternative for primary care and endocrinology clinics without access to VCTE.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    EASL-ERN position paper on liver involvement in patients with Fontan-type circulation.\r\nHowever, based on the increasing number of adult Fontan patients and recent research interest, the European Association for The Study of the Liver and the European Reference Network on Rare Liver Diseases thought a position paper timely. The aims of the current paper are: (1) to provide a clear definition and description of FALD, including clinical, analytical, radiological, haemodynamic, and histological features;  (2) to facilitate guidance for staging the liver disease;  and (3) to provide evidence- and experience-based recommendations for the management of different clinical scenarios.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeta-analysis\r\nmeta-analyses and systematic reviews\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Systematic review: Glycomics as diagnostic markers for hepatocellular carcinoma.\r\nAlterations in serum N-glycomics, characterised by increased levels of fucosylation and branching, have potential as diagnostic biomarkers for HCC.

Increased comorbidity, large hospital size, public insurance, and urban teaching hospitals were associated with higher rates of CDI. CDI was associated with increased mortality in hospitalized patients with IBD. Continued vigilance, infection control, and treatment of CDI can help continue the trend of declining infection rates.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRetrospective cohort study: Effect of age as a barrier to diagnosis of eosinophilic oesophagitis.\r\nElderly patients with EoE have <50% the odds of oesophageal biopsies.

Fibro-PeN offers improved performance characteristics for risk stratification by identifying moderate-to-severe fibrosis in children with NAFLD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFMO2 ameliorates nonalcoholic fatty liver disease by suppressing ER-to-Golgi transport of SREBP1.\r\n In hepatocytes, FMO2 is a novel molecule that protects against the progression of NAFL/NASH independent of enzyme activity. FMO2 impairs lipogenesis in HFD or CDAHFD-induced steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis by directly binding to SREBP1 and preventing its organelle translocation and subsequent activation. FMO2 thus is a promising molecule for targeting the activation of SREBP1 and for the treatment of NAFL/NASH.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImpact of radiological response and pattern of progression in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma treated by atezolizumab- bevacizumab.\r\nRECIST 1.1 and mRECIST criteria predict OS with more responders identified by mRECIST and appearance of new extrahepatic lesion or vascular invasion was associated with a poor prognosis. A noticeable discrepancy was observed between patients classified as progressor at reviewing and the decision reached during MTB.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMacrophage STING-YAP axis controls hepatic steatosis by promoting autophagic degradation of lipid droplets.\r\n Macrophage STING-YAP axis controls hepatic steatosis by reprogramming lipid metabolism in a TMEM205/MFN2/PDI-dependent pathway. These findings highlight the regulatory mechanism of macrophage STING-driven YAP activity on lipid control.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMendelian randomization in hepatology: A review of principles, opportunities, and challenges.\r\nIn this concise review, we describe the concepts, assumptions, and interpretation of Mendelian Randomization as related to studies in hepatology. We focus on the strengths and weaknesses of the approach for a non-statistical audience, using an illustrative example to assess the causal relationship between body mass index and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNew insights into the molecular basis of alcohol abstinence and relapse in alcohol-associated liver disease.\r\nIn addition, support with psychological and behavioral treatments is essential to address the multiple dimensions of AUD. In the future, a personalized approach considering these novel targets can contribute to significantly decreasing the alcohol-related burden of disease.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nWnt/ß-catenin and NFB signaling synergize to trigger growth-factor-free regeneration of adult primary human hepatocytes.\r\nThis study revealed a network of NFB, TGFß, and Wnt/ß-catenin that controls human hepatocyte regeneration in the absence of exogenous growth factors, identified novel regulators of hepatocyte proliferation, and highlighted the potential of organotypic culture systems for chemogenomic interrogation of complex physiological processes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    A prospective, multicenter, three-cohort study evaluating contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) in patients with cirrhosis.\r\nAKI risk after CECT in cirrhosis is low, not significantly different from that of the general population and of the cirrhotic population unexposed to ICM. It mostly consists in mild and rapidly resolving episodes of renal dysfunction and it is not associated with tubular kidney injury. Patients with ongoing infections appear to be the only ones at higher risk of AKI. Impact and implications Nephrotoxicity due to intravenous iodinated contrast media (ICM) in patients with cirrhosis is still a debated issue, as the available evidence is limited and based on very heterogeneous studies, often conducted on small and retrospective cohorts. In this prospective three-cohort study we found that intravenous administration of ICM was associated with a low risk of AKI, similar to that of the general population and to that of patients with cirrhosis unexposed to ICM. Patients with ongoing infections were the only to have a significantly increased risk of CI-AKI. Therefore, the actual recommendations of performing contrast imaging studies cautiously in cirrhosis do not seem to be reasonable anymore, with the exception of infected patients, which have a significantly higher risk of CI-AKI.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHigher TP53BP2 expression is associated with HBsAg loss in peginterferon-alpha-treated patients with chronic hepatitis B.\r\n Rs7519753 C allele is associated with an increased probability of serum HBsAg loss in patients with CHB post-Peg-IFNa treatment and elevated hepatic TP53BP2 expression. TP53BP2 enhances the response of the hepatocyte to IFN-a by suppressing SOCS2 expression. Impact and implications Chronic Hepatitis B (CHB) remains a global public health issue. Although current antiviral therapies are more effective in halting disease progression, only a few patients achieve functional cure for hepatitis B with HBsAg loss, highlighting the urgent need for a cure for CHB. This study revealed that the SNP rs7519753 C allele, which is associated with high expression of hepatic TP53BP2, significantly increases the likelihood of serum HBsAg loss in CHB patients undergoing Peg-IFNa therapy. This finding not only provides an exciting predictor for HBsAg loss but identifies a potential therapeutic target for Peg-IFNa treatment. We believe our results are of great interest to a wide range of stakeholders, including patients and patient organizations, the medical community, academia, the life science industry, and the general public.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImmune responses and clinical outcomes after COVID-19 vaccination in patients with liver disease and in liver transplant recipients.\r\n After three COVID-19 vaccines, patients with liver disease generally develop robust antibody and T cell responses to vaccination and have mild COVID-19. However, LTR have sustained no/low antibody titres and appear most vulnerable to severe disease. Impact and implications Standardised assessments of the immune response to different COVID-19 vaccines in patients liver disease are lacking. We performed antibody and T cell assays at multiple timepoints following up to three vaccine doses in a large cohort of patients with a range of liver conditions. Overall, the three most widely available vaccine platforms were immunogenic and appeared to protect against severe breakthrough COVID-19. This will provide reassurance to patients with chronic liver disease who were deemed at high risk of severe COVID-19 during the pre-vaccination era, however, liver transplant recipients had the lowest antibody titres and remained vulnerable to severe breakthrough infection. We also characterise the immune response to multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants and describe the interaction between disease type, severity, and vaccine platform. These insights may prove useful in the event of future viral infections which also require rapid vaccine development and delivery to liver patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPredicting survival in patients with 'non-high-risk' acute variceal bleeding receiving ß-blockers+ligation to prevent re-bleeding.\r\n The majority of 'non-high-risk' patients with AVB have an excellent outcome, if treated according to current recommendations. However, about one fifth of patients, i.e., those with CTP =8 and/or high creatinine levels or hyponatremia, have a considerable risk of death within 1 year of the index bleed. Future clinical trials should investigate whether elective TIPS placement reduces mortality in these patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the publisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Blue Notes.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCommon Instances of Low-value Care in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.\r\nThis review is meant to bring attention to value-based care in IBD and provide guidance to treating practitioners.

However, about one fifth of patients, i.e., those with CTP =8 and/or high creatinine levels or hyponatremia, have a considerable risk of death within 1 year of the index bleed. Future clinical trials should investigate whether elective TIPS placement reduces mortality in these patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTherapeutic vaccination with lentiviral vector in HBV-persistent mice and two inactive HBsAg carriers.\r\nA lentiviral-vectored therapeutic vaccine for chronic HBV infection demonstrated the potential to improve HBV-specific T cell response and deplete HBV-positive hepatocytes, leading to a sustained loss or reduction of serum HBsAg.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the publisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Editorial: Continuous monitoring to improve outcome of treatment-the next step towards safe and effective faecal microbiota transplantation.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Faecal microbiota transplantation in IBS-Moving closer or away from success?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Time to consider early treatment for chronic hepatitis B in both children and adults.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Unravelling the fibres-low dietary fibre may lower risk of developing IBD.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Embracing Change: From NAFLD to MASLD under the Steatotic Liver Disease Umbrella.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    ADDITIONAL MEASURES AFTER STOPPING NUCLEOSIDE ANALOGUES IN HBEAG NEGATIVE CHRONIC HEPATITIS B: BETTER BUT NOT ENOUGH.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAntireflux surgery does not prevent cancer in Barrett's esophagus.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous\r\nmisc publications eg case reports, tools of the trade, images of the month, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Gastroenterol\r\n    An unusual case of isolated gastric cap polyposis.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastric Alimetry: A Reset of the Field of Gastric Electrophysiologic Testing for Nausea and Other Symptoms? \r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThree-Dimensional Modeling to Guide Interventional Endoscopy in Fibrostenotic Crohn's Disease.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopy\r\n    Cutting-edge novel device in the treatment of obesity.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nSimplified endoscopic septotomy for a large symptomatic Zenker's diverticulum.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nSingle-use duodenoscopes: is performance enough?
