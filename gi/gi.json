There were some drugs that caused HC injury with jaundice but with mortality rates <10%. Refinement of Hy's Law is warranted.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nS3260 An Interesting Case of Lymphocytic Esophagitis In Association With Pityriasis LichenoidesChronica and Rheumatoid Arthritis.\r\n LyE typically manifests in females during their 5th-6th decades, presenting a notable contrast to eosinophilic esophagitis (EOE), which predominantly affects males in their 2nd-3rd decades. However, the endoscopic appearance of LyE often mirrors that of EOE. Studies suggest potential associations between LyE and Crohn's disease in children, as well as primary esophageal dysmotility in adults. Notably, our patient has a history of rheumatoid arthritis, a correlation observed in 2 other cases in the literature. While limited literature exists on pityriasis lichenoideschronica with esophageal involvement, specifically presenting as LyE, this singular case underscores the interconnection of these 2 disease processes. These observations raise the possibility of an autoimmune etiology. There is no consensus on the lymphocyte count threshold for diagnosis, a challenge compounded by the rarity of the disease, leading to a lack of definitive guidelines for optimal management.JOURNAL/ajgast/04.03/00000434-202410001-03261/figure1/v/2024-10-11T031912Z/r/image-tiff.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTreatment preference archetypes in eosinophilic esophagitis and their implications for therapy.\r\nWe identified three distinct treatment preference archetypes among individuals with EoE, underscoring the need for personalized treatment strategies, especially for those favoring natural approaches but masking ambivalence, and may be at risk for nonadherence or loss to follow-up.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    High hospitalization rates and risk factors among frail patients with cirrhosis: A 10-year population-based cohort study.\r\n Compensated and decompensated cirrhosis patients with intermediate to severe frailty face a substantially increased odds of annual hospitalizations compared to those with low frailty. Future work should focus on targeted interventions to incorporate routine frailty screenings into cirrhosis care and to ultimately minimize high hospitalization rates.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopy\r\n    A novel endoscopic artificial intelligence system to assist in the diagnosis of autoimmune gastritis: a multicenter study.\r\nSEER-SCOPE AI demonstrated expert-level performance in identifying AIG, and enhanced the diagnostic ability of endoscopists. Its application holds promise as a potent endoscopy-assisted tool for guiding biopsy sampling and early detection of AIG.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nProspective randomized trial comparing conventional and underwater endoscopic submucosal dissection for superficial colorectal neoplasms.\r\nResults We analyzed the data of 69 and 70 CESD and UESD cases, respectively;  however, no significant differences were found in median dissection speed (17.4 and 19.9 mm 2 /min, respectively;  UESD did not expedite dissection speed in the overall patient population. CESD and UESD may be complementary in the colorectum depending on the PLG.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nShort-Term Clinical and Technical Outcomes of a Modified Zenker's Peroral Endoscopic Myotomy (Z-POEM) With Mucosal Flap Incision.\r\n Z-POEM with MFI has a high rate of technical and clinical success.

HRCM shows that IBS-C patients have reduced PPW activity.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nECM1 attenuates hepatic fibrosis by interfering with mediators of latent TGF-β1 activation.\r\n Our findings underscore the hepatoprotective effect of ECM1, which interferes with mediators of LTGF-β1 activation, suggesting ECM1 or its representative peptide as potential antifibrotic therapies in CLD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIQGAP3 signalling mediates intratumoral functional heterogeneity to enhance malignant growth.\r\n IQGAP3 knockdown suppressed the RAS-TGFβ signalling crosstalk, leading to a significant reduction of the tumour microenvironment. In particular, IQGAP3 maintains functional heterogeneity of cancer cells to enhance malignant growth. IQGAP3 is thus a highly relevant therapy target in GC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe serum concentration of the third component of complement beta-1C-beta-1A in liver disease.\r\nHowever, 10 patients (six with active chronic hepatitis, four with cryptogenic cirrhosis) had hypocomplementaemia. The reason for the depression is not clear but could reflect either decreased synthesis or increased consumption, or a combination of the two.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nHepatology\r\n    Disparities in screening and risk stratification for hispanic adults with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.\r\nLower NIT cut-points may be needed to optimize surveillance for significant fibrosis due to MASLD in Hispanic populations commensurate with their higher burden and severity of disease.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe de-sulfinylation enzyme sulfiredoxin-1 attenuates hepatic stellate cell activation and liver fibrosis by modulating the PTPN12-NLRP3 axis.\r\nOur findings have uncovered an important role of SRXN1 and protein S-sulfinylation in HSC activation and liver fibrosis. The SRXN1-PTPN12-NLRP3 axis represents potential therapeutic targets for liver fibrosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    A metabolome-derived score predicts metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis and mortality from liver disease.\r\n The metabolome-derived MASH prediction score accurately predicts risk of MASH and MASLD-related mortality in both Chinese and European individuals. Impact and implications Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is associated with more than a 10-fold increase in liver-related death. However, biomarkers predicting not only MASH, but also death due to liver disease, are missing. We established a MASH prediction score based on 44 clinical parameters and 250 plasma metabolites using a machine learning strategy. This metabolome-derived MASH prediction score could accurately identify patients with MASH among both Chinese and Finnish individuals, and it was superior to the FIB-4 index and the NAFLD Fibrosis Score in predicting MASLD-related death in the general population. Thus, the new MASH prediction score is a useful tool for identifying individuals with a markedly increased risk of serious liver-related outcomes among at-risk and general populations.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nConcordance of ctDNA and tissue genomic profiling in advanced biliary tract cancer.\r\nAmong patients with advanced BTC, ctDNA-based genotyping showed acceptable concordance with tissue genomic profiling. Liquid biopsy using ctDNA could be a valuable complement to tissue-based genomic analysis in BTC. Impact and implications Our study is the first large-scale investigation of the clinical utility of liquid biopsy, focusing on ctDNA, as an alternative to conventional tumor tissue analysis, among Asian patients with advanced BTC. The results demonstrated acceptable concordance between analysis of ctDNA versus tissue for identifying therapeutic targets and potentially actionable genetic alterations. This indicates that ctDNA analysis can provide critical insights regarding advanced BTC treatment, particularly in cases where it is challenging to obtain or analyze tumor tissue.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHyperfunctional T cell responses unchecked by regulatory T cells are unable to resolve hepaciviral infection without humoral contribution.\r\nTregs control the outcome of RHV infection via direct modulation of CD4 + T cells and IgG production. Hyperactivated T cell responses are incapable of compensating for experimentally induced lack of antibodies, further reinforcing the notion of cooperative interplay between adaptive immune arms in facilitating hepaciviral clearance. Impact and implications We demonstrate herein how timing of Treg depletion determines the fate of effector T cells, humoral responses, and the kinetics of viral clearance. Our observations provide direct evidence that functional T cell responses are incapable of compensating for suboptimal humoral responses in facilitating viral resolution. Our results imply that future HCV vaccine regimens should not solely rely on eliciting focused responses of a single effector arm, but rather incorporate immunogens capable of inducing durable features of both humoral and cellular memory.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOral-gut microbiome interactions in advanced cirrhosis: characterisation of pathogenic enterotypes and salivatypes, virulence factors and antimicrobial.\r\n The degree of oral-gut microbial community overlap, frequency of VFs and ARGs al increment significantly with cirrhosis severity, with progressive dominance of pathobionts and loss of commensals. Despite similar antimicrobial exposure, patients with DC and ACLF have reduced microbial richness compared to NLS, supporting the additive pathobiological effect of cirrhosis. Impact and implications This research underscores the crucial role of microbiome alterations in the progression of cirrhosis in an era of escalating multidrug resistant infections, highlighting the association and potential impact of increased oral-gut microbial overlap, virulence factors, and antimicrobial resistance genes on clinical outcomes. These findings are particularly significant for patients with decompensated cirrhosis and acute-on-chronic liver failure, as they reveal the intricate relationship between microbiome alterations and cirrhosis complications. This is relevant in the context of multidrug-resistant organisms and reduced oral-gut microbial diversity that exacerbate cirrhosis severity, drive hepatic decompensation and complicate treatment. For practical applications, these insights could guide for cirrhosis patients the development of targeted microbiome-based therapeutics and personalised antimicrobial regimens to mitigate infectious complications to improve their clinical outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Editorial: The Impact of Socioeconomic and Ethnic Factors on Chronic Liver Disease.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) in Ulcerative Colitis: Holding Out for a Superdonor?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFunctional cure in a long-term follow-up of Children with chronic hepatitis B.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut Goo: Physiology, Diet, and Therapy of Intestinal Mucus and Biofilms in Gastrointestinal Health and Disease.\r\nA final goal is to review how certain dietary factors, especially low-fiber diets and emulsifiers common in Western diets, can harm the mucus layer.

The validation with NG-497 opens a new therapeutic perspective for MASLD. Impact and implications The global prevalence of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a crucial public health concern. Since adherence to behavioural interventions is limited, pharmacological strategies are necessary, as highlighted by the recent FDA approval of resmetirom. However, since our current mechanistic understanding and pathophysiology-oriented therapeutic options for MASLD are still limited, novel mechanistic insights are urgently needed. Our present work uncovers that pharmacological inhibition of ATGL, the key enzyme in lipid hydrolysis using Atglistatin (ATGLi), improves metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), fibrosis, and associated key features of metabolic dysfunction in a mouse model of MASH and MCD-induced liver fibrosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that attenuation of PPARα signalling in the liver and gut favours hydrophilic bile acid composition, ultimately interfering with dietary lipid absorption. One of the drawbacks of ATGLi is its lack of efficacy against human ATGL, thus limiting its clinical applicability. Against this backdrop, we could show that ATGL inhibition using the human inhibitor NG-497 in human primary ileum-derived organoids, Caco2 cells, and HepG2 cells translated into therapeutic mechanisms similar to ATGLi. Collectively, these findings open a new avenue for MASLD treatment development by inhibiting human ATGL activity.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPNPLA3 rs738409, environmental factors and liver-related mortality in the U.S. Population.\r\nPNPLA3 is associated with LRD and this relationship is significantly modified by anthropometric and environmental factors.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPlasma exchange does not improve overall survival in patients with acute liver failure in a real world cohort.\r\n PEX is now frequently used in the management of ALF patients in the UK.

Provided the colon is cleared of synchronous neoplasia, the next surveillance can be potentially extended to 3-5 years. Such an approach would reduce costs and enhance patient compliance.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNuclear translocation of plasma membrane protein ADCY7 potentiates T cell-mediated antitumour immunity in HCC.\r\n We delineate the unconventional function and subcellular location of ADCY7, highlighting its pivotal role in T cell-mediated immunity in HCC and its potential as a promising treatment target.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSpatial single-cell profiling and neighbourhood analysis reveal the determinants of immune architecture connected to checkpoint inhibitor therapy outcome in hepatocellular carcinoma.\r\nProgression-free survival under ICI therapy differed significantly between the spatial immune types with improved survival of enriched patients.

Focusing on changes in air pollution-related metabolic signatures may offer a new perspective for preventing air pollution-induced MASLD and serve as protective measures to address this emerging public health challenge.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDecreases in cT1 and liver fat content reflect treatment-induced histological improvements in MASH.\r\nThese results, from three combined drug trials, demonstrate that changes in multiparametric MRI markers of liver health (cT1 and PDFF) can predict histological response for steatohepatitis following therapeutic intervention. Impact and implications There is great interest in identifying suitable biomarkers that can be used to replace liver biopsy, or to identify those patients who would benefit from one, in both the clinical management of MASH and in drug development. We investigated the utility of two MRI-derived non-invasive tests, iron corrected T1 mapping (cT1) and liver fat content from proton density fat fraction (PDFF), to predict histological improvement in patients who had undergone experimental treatment for MASH. Using data from 150 people who participated in one of three clinical trials, we observed that a reduction in cT1 by over 80 ms and a relative reduction in PDFF of over 58% were the optimal thresholds for change that predicted resolution of steatohepatitis. PDFF as a marker of liver fat, and cT1 as a specific measure of liver disease activity, are both effective at identifying those who are likely responding to drug interventions and experiencing improvements in overall liver health.

Small-molecule intervention validated hepatocyte AQP8 as a promising drug target for gallstone therapy. Impact and implications The incidence of gallstone disease is high, and current drug treatments for gallstones are very limited, necessitating the identification of novel drug targets for developing new drugs with universal applicability. To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide direct evidence that hepatic water channel AQP8 plays a key role in bile dilution and gallstone formation. Modulation of hepatic water transport may provide a universal therapeutic strategy for al types of gallstone diseases.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Endoscopy\r\n    ESGE and ESGENA - A Growing and Successful Partnership!\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopy E-Videos - recently published.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    It Runs in the Family: What Studying Unaffected Individuals in Simplex and Multiplex Families Tells Us About IBD Development.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSurveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhosis: End of monopoly for serum alpha fetoprotein.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    Beyond borders: When will Western countries follow Japanese progress in endoscopic diagnosis and treatment of superficial pharyngeal cancer?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Bile acid metabolism and signaling in liver disease.\r\nAdditionally, impaired BA signaling may also affect the intestine and kidney, thereby contributing to failure of gut integrity driving the progression and complications of portal hypertension, cholemic nephropathy and the development of extrahepatic malignancies such as colorectal cancer.
