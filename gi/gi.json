These findings confer GPR91 as a promising target for molecular interventions in blocking MASH-fibrotic progression.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTATA-box binding protein associated factor 2 (TAF2) in hepatocyte survival and tumorigenesis.\r\nTAF2 augmented cancer hallmarks in human HCC cells by binding to the promoters of tumor promoting genes and non-coding RNAs and regulating their transcription. Thus, TAF2 plays a unique and central role in hepatocyte survival and tumorigenesis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Durvalumab plus chemotherapy in advanced biliary tract cancer: 3-year overall survival update from the phase III TOPAZ-1 study.\r\nSurvival benefit and manageable safety continued with durvalumab+GemCis versus placebo+GemCis approximately 3 years after the last participant was randomised. All clinically relevant subgroups were represented in eLTS, supporting standard-of-care status for durvalumab+GemCis in aBTC.  \r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Editorial: Breath Profiling in MASLD-A Step Towards Better Risk Stratification.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Getting to the Heart of the Matter in IBD.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Three-Dimensional (3D) Geometric Modelling in TIPS Implantation-A Further Step Toward Personalised Portal Pressure Reduction?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReview Article: GLP-1 Receptor Agonists and Glucagon/GIP/GLP-1 Receptor Dual or Triple Agonists-Mechanism of Action and Emerging Therapeutic Landscape in MASLD.\r\nGLP-1 receptor agonists, alone or in combination with GIP and/or glucagon receptor agonists, represent promising, effective pharmacotherapies for the treatment of MASLD/MASH. Larger and longer-duration clinical trials are needed to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of GIP receptor and glucagon receptor agonism.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    American Gastroenterological Association Policy Priorities for our 2025 Legislative Agenda.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDetermining Cirrhosis Status in Candidates for Resmetirom.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLong-term use of topical steroids in Eosinophilic Esophagitis: efficacy, safety, and unanswered questions.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Pharmacomicrobiomics: The role of the gut microbiome in immunomodulation and cancer therapy.\r\nWe also shed light on the future perspectives for patients arising from this field.

An individualised patient-centred risk assessment by a multidisciplinary team including hepatologists, surgeons, anaesthesiologists, and other support teams is essential.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEASL Clinical Practice Guidelines on the management of autoimmune hepatitis.\r\nThe aim of these EASL guidelines is to provide updated guidance on the diagnosis and management of AIH both in adults and children. Updated guidance on the management of patients with variants and specific forms of AIH is also provided, as is detailed guidance on the management of AIH-associated cirrhosis, including surveillance for portal hypertension and hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as liver transplantation in decompensated cirrhosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEASL Clinical Practice Guidelines on the management of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.\r\nOwing to recent developments and the significant differences in CCA subtypes, EASL commissioned a panel of experts to draft evidence-based recommendations on the management of extrahepatic CCA, comprising distal and perihilar CCA. Particular attention is given to the need for accurate classification systems, the integration of emerging molecular insights, and practical strategies for diagnosis and treatment that reflect real-world clinical scenarios.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEASL Clinical Practice Guidelines on the management of hepatitis B virus infection.\r\nThe guidelines also discuss emerging biomarkers and evolving definitions of functional and partial cure. Developed through literature review, expert consensus, and a Delphi process, the guidelines aim to equip healthcare providers across disciplines with practical tools to optimise HBV care and outcomes worldwide.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeta-analysis\r\nmeta-analyses and systematic reviews\r\n\r\n\r\n    Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Medical Therapy for Acute Severe Ulcerative Colitis: A Systematic Review with Meta-analysis.\r\nIFX may be more efficacious than CsA for the treatment of ASUC. Janus kinase inhibitors are promising treatment options in select individuals. Future studies should explore the efficacy of other advanced therapies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Diabetes Mellitus in Patients With Autoimmune Hepatitis: Frequency, Risk Factors and Effect on Outcome.\r\n New-onset DM occurred in 13% of patients with AIH, was related to older age, non-Caucasian ethnicity, higher prednisolone dose, higher BMI at diagnosis and weight gain;  and was an independent predictor of all-cause death/transplantation and of cirrhosis development, underlining the need to minimise steroid burden in AIH.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Association between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and risk of early onset colorectal cancer.\r\n NAFLD is positively associated with an increased risk of early-onset CRC, particularly in the left colon and rectum. These findings highlight the need for multifaceted preventive strategies, including lifestyle interventions and expanded screening for younger populations with NAFLD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCT-colonography in Fecal Immunochemical Test Positives in a Colorectal Cancer Screening Program.\r\n CTC in FIT-positive screenees was associated with a lower AN detection rate and a higher PCT-CRC rate compared to what is known from colonoscopy. A substantial proportion of complications occurred, and quality reporting was often lacking. This underlines the need for a structured quality assurance program for CTCs performed in FIT-positives. Critical appraisal who to refer for CTC and communication about the benefits and pitfalls of CTC is warranted.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopic Submucosal Dissection for Previously Attempted Colorectal Lesions: An International Multicenter Experience.\r\n Salvage ESD is highly effective in the treatment of PACLs. When performed by experts, AEs were uncommon and mostly managed endoscopically.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Transplant is Associated with a Reduced Risk of Colorectal Dysplasia in patients with IBD and concomitant PSC.\r\n Liver transplantation was associated with a reduced risk of colon cancer/dysplasia in patients with PSC-IBD in our cohort.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nYoung adults with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease have an increased risk of early-onset cancer.\r\n Young adults with MASLD, MetALD, or ALD are at increased risk of developing early-onset cancer.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopy\r\n    A novel technique for submucosal tumors in esophagus: mucosal zipper endoscopic resection.\r\n MZER seems to provide an optional treatment for proximal or larger esophageal SMTs. The efficacy and safety profiles need further validation through multicenter studies with larger cohorts, given the current limitations of sample size and single-center design.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    Combined phosphorus-32 implantation and chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone for locally advanced pancreatic cancer: a propensity-score weighted landmark analysis.\r\n In this comparative study between combined chemotherapy and 32 P microparticles implantation with standard chemotherapy for patients with LAPC, the combination showed better survival, disease control and downstaging. The outcomes highlight the need for a randomized controlled trial.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOutcomes of Endoscopic Ultrasound-Guided Liver Biopsy Using 22-Gauge vs. 19-Gauge Needles with a Novel Hydrostatic Sampling Technique.\r\nWhen using the HST, EUS-LB with 22G needles meets adequacy standards at high rates similar to 19G needles. The HST may allow for the use of 22G needles in patients at high risk for adverse events or with challenging anatomies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    Beneficial infections of the enterovirus genus in patients with liver cancer.\r\nOur results suggest that past exposures to members of the Enterovirus genus may be advantageous for cancer patients, highlighting the potential for a viral peptide-based HCC vaccine.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    GPD1L supports glycerol-3-phosphate and triacylglycerol synthesis and promotes tumor progression in hepatocellular carcinoma.\r\nGPD1L is overexpressed in human HCCs and associated with worse clinical outcomes. Aberrant GPD1L expression, driven by ELF1, facilitates conversion of DHAP to G3P conversion to support triacylglycerol synthesis in HCC, promoting tumor growth and metastasis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatic stellate cell heterogeneity: Functional aspects and therapeutic implications.\r\nWe explore the spatiotemporal diversity of HSCs, highlighting their subpopulations and their specialized roles, as well as the complex bidirectional communications between HSCs, hepatocytes, endothelial cells, macrophages/monocytes, T cells, and tumor cells. By integrating insights from single-cell sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, preclinical data and clinical data, this review aims to provide an updated understanding of how HSC heterogeneity contributes to liver homeostasis and disease and can be targeted for therapeutic purposes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Decoding the Resistin-CAP1 Pathway in Intermediate Monocytes Mediating Liver Allograft Rejection.\r\n These findings offer insights into the dynamic changes in the alloimmune microenvironment, pinpointing intermediate monocytes as potential diagnostic and immunotherapeutic targets during allograft rejection. This study holds significant importance in advancing non-invasive diagnostic technologies and immunotherapeutic strategies for allogeneic rejection. Impact and implications This study pioneers the application of spatial transcriptomics in liver transplantation, providing a comprehensive analysis of immune cell spatial distribution, complemented by Souporcell-based chimerism assessment. We demonstrate that intermediate monocytes play a pivotal role in T cell-mediated acute rejection via the Resistin-CAP1 signaling axis. Targeting this pathway using nanogold-siRNA technology effectively mitigates rejection and enhances graft survival. These findings contribute novel insights into the mechanisms of transplant rejection and present promising avenues for the development of targeted therapeutic and diagnostic strategies in liver transplantation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHigh inherited risk predicts age-associated increases in fibrosis in patients with MASLD.\r\n GRS, PRS-HFC, PRS-5, and PNPLA3 genotypes alone are associated with greater fibrosis per decade, resulting in divergent disease trajectories starting in midlife. Assessing genetic risk in MASLD will identify high-risk patients who require more frequent monitoring. Impact and implications This study provides granular evidence that genetic predisposition, particularly the PNPLA3 G/G genotype, significantly influences the trajectory of liver fibrosis in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), with a more pronounced impact emerging after the fourth decade of life. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating genetic risk assessment into MASLD management, as it allows for the early identification of high-risk individuals who may benefit from more frequent monitoring and targeted interventions. Given the rising global burden of MASLD, clinicians, researchers, and policymakers should consider integrating genetic stratification into existing risk assessment frameworks to refine screening and surveillance strategies. By optimizing patient selection for non-invasive fibrosis assessment and potential therapeutic interventions, this approach could enhance precision medicine efforts and may improve long-term outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSafety and efficacy of elafibranor in primary sclerosing cholangitis: The ELMWOOD phase II randomized-controlled trial.\r\nElafibranor was well tolerated in people with PSC and associated with greater biochemical improvements over 12 weeks compared with placebo. A greater magnitude of response was observed with elafibranor 120 mg compared with 80 mg. Impact and implications For people with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), there is a need for a well-tolerated and effective treatment that will enhance quality of life, prevent disease progression, and improve long-term outcomes. Here, we present results from the double-blind period of the phase II ELMWOOD trial in PSC, wherein elafibranor, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α/δ agonist, demonstrated a favorable safety profile, provided greater biochemical improvements over 12 weeks compared with placebo, and appeared to stabilize markers of fibrosis and improve pruritus. These findings support larger and longer term investigations of elafibranor to explore its therapeutic potential as a treatment for people with PSC.\r\nPubmed   Journal

AAs are an independent risk factor for PCCRC. Lynch syndrome patients with AAs should be identified as high-risk and undergo enhanced colonoscopy surveillance.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInadequate Propulsion and Pelvic Floor Relaxation in Dyssynergic Defecation: Insights from Synchronous Proctomanometry.\r\nEarly events - increased rectal pressure (propulsive force), anorectal angle (puborectalis relaxation), and anorectal descent (perineal relaxation) - determine evacuation. Body position and rectal filling affect the rectoanal gradient. Most DD patients have both impaired propulsion and relaxation. Constipated patients with a prolonged BET and/or reduced evacuation have DD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    Improved clinical outcomes of patients with cirrhosis and acute variceal bleeding over the last two decades.\r\n Recurrent bleeding and mortality rates after AVB improved over the last two decades but remain substantial, highlighting the need for continued efforts to optimize outcomes for patients with cirrhosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    Microbiota fasting-related changes ameliorate cognitive decline in obesity and boost ex vivo microglial function through the gut-brain axis.\r\n Fasting-induced modifications in gut microbiota contribute to cognitive improvement in individuals with obesity, with microglial cells playing a crucial mediatory role. Among the interventions, ADF most effectively enhanced microglial function and cognitive performance, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic strategy for obesity-related cognitive decline. Further studies are required to fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    Altered blood-brain barrier permeability is associated with abnormal distant connectivity and regional homogeneity in covert hepatic encephalopathy - a cross sectional study.\r\n There was a strong association between disrupted blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity and attenuated functional connectivity, with reductions in functional connectivity within the DMN and Frontoparietal Network (FPN), circuits closely linked to executive control. This attenuation was evident both in local regional and in distant connectivity within these networks.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nComparison of diagnostic accuracy and utility of non-invasive tests for clinically significant liver disease in a general population with metabolic dysfunction.\r\nOf the 10 investigated NITs, MAF-5 discriminated best between al conditions except cirrhosis, for which SAFE yielded the highest accuracy. The performance of FIB-4 was poor, implying that referral pathways for significant liver disease in low-prevalence populations can be improved when more accurate NITs such as MAF-5 are employed.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatic stellate cell heterogeneity: Functional aspects and therapeutic implications.\r\nWe explore the spatiotemporal diversity of HSCs, highlighting their subpopulations and their specialized roles, as well as the complex bidirectional communications between HSCs, hepatocytes, endothelial cells, macrophages/monocytes, T cells, and tumor cells. By integrating insights from single-cell sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, preclinical data and clinical data, this review aims to provide an updated understanding of how HSC heterogeneity contributes to liver homeostasis and disease and can be targeted for therapeutic purposes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMetabolic reprograming of immune cells in MASH.\r\nHowever, research on the metabolic characteristics of other types of immune cells remains limited. With the development of single-cell genomics and animal models of MASH, we anticipate that further studies in this compelling field may shed light on the pathogenesis of MASH and pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOrgan damage proteomic signature identifies patients with MASLD at-risk of systemic complications.\r\nOur study provides a framework for potential mechanisms associated with systemic diseases that facilitates holistic management by stratifying patients with MASLD into subclasses at-risk of extrahepatic manifestations.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    High inherited risk predicts age-associated increases in fibrosis in patients with MASLD.\r\n GRS, PRS-HFC, PRS-5, and PNPLA3 genotypes alone are associated with greater fibrosis per decade, resulting in divergent disease trajectories starting in midlife. Assessing genetic risk in MASLD will identify high-risk patients who require more frequent monitoring. Impact and implications This study provides granular evidence that genetic predisposition, particularly the PNPLA3 G/G genotype, significantly influences the trajectory of liver fibrosis in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), with a more pronounced impact emerging after the fourth decade of life. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating genetic risk assessment into MASLD management, as it allows for the early identification of high-risk individuals who may benefit from more frequent monitoring and targeted interventions. Given the rising global burden of MASLD, clinicians, researchers, and policymakers should consider integrating genetic stratification into existing risk assessment frameworks to refine screening and surveillance strategies. By optimizing patient selection for non-invasive fibrosis assessment and potential therapeutic interventions, this approach could enhance precision medicine efforts and may improve long-term outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNew platinum derivatives selectively cause double-strand DNA breaks and death in naïve and cisplatin-resistant cholangiocarcinomas.\r\nAurkines represent promising therapeutic drugs for both naïve and cisplatin-resistant cancers due to their unique polyelectrophilic properties and selective targeting of malignant cells. Impact and implications This study introduces a novel therapeutic strategy designed to induce frequent double-strand DNA breaks selectively in both naïve and cisplatin-resistant cancer cells, without evident toxic side effects at therapeutic doses. This approach may settle the basis for new strategies to overcome the critical challenge of drug resistance in cancer treatment, and has the potential to be a breakthrough not only for the treatment of biliary tumors but also for other cancers.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Editorial: Real-World Effectiveness of Mirikizumab in Ulcerative Colitis-A Valuable but Preliminary Glimpse.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Effectiveness of Medical Therapies for Joint, Skin and Eye Extraintestinal Manifestations in IBD-An Umbrella Review.\r\nEvidence for medical therapies for joint, skin and eye EIMs in IBD is heterogeneous and of low quality. Further research is needed, including a multidisciplinary approach and novel and practical methods for endpoint evaluation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Advances in Locoregional and Systemic Treatments for HCC.\r\nThese improved outcomes raise several new questions including which patients with liver-localized HCC should receive systemic therapy, how should this be sequenced or combined with other available therapies, and how to manage those patients with marked responses, including consideration of liver transplantation. These questions are often determined on a case-by-case basis and best made in a multidisciplinary manner, considering several factors including tumor burden, degree of liver dysfunction, performance status, and patient's long-term goals of care.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIn Memoriam: John S. Fordtran, MD.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    Endoscopy in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: What Every Endoscopist Should Know.\r\n This review underscores the critical role of endoscopy in optimizing patient outcomes through accurate diagnosis, therapeutic precision, and the integration of emerging technologies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Combined Liver with Other Solid Organ Transplants: Promises, Pitfalls and ethical dilemmas, An Expert Opinion.\r\nImmunological advantages, advanced risk assessments, and novel technologies, such as machine perfusion, improve success rates.
