Our study highlights the importance of monitoring dynamic changes at the protein and organelle levels during anticancer treatment, providing robust evidence for functional precision oncology. Impact and implications This study identifies that high INF2 expression at baseline is associated with poor prognosis in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) patients. Moreover, cisplatin-induced INF2 degradation via proteasomal and SEC62-mediated ER-phagy is revealed as a key driver of mitochondrial hyperfusion and chemoresistance in CCA. It establishes mitochondrial morphology targeting as a novel strategy to overcome chemotherapy resistance. Furthermore, this study emphasizes the need to focus on dynamic changes in tumor proteins or organelle functions during treatment (functional precise oncology), rather than limiting analysis to static tumor states. Given that inhibition of oncogenes may lead to potential resistance mechanisms, comprehensive preclinical evaluations are essential before clinical application.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Neurogastroenterol Motil\r\n    Association Between Caffeine Intake and Stool Frequency- or Consistency-Defined Constipation: Data From the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005-2010. \r\nCaffeine consumption is not associated with stool frequency or consistency-defined constipation.

This recommendation is weak, because the evidence is limited with considerable uncertainty of the evidence estimates, the absolute benefits for colorectal cancer incidence and mortality are small, and there is a patient burden associated with CADe (more polyp overdiagnosis and more colonoscopy surveillance).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis.\r\nThe aim of this guideline is to review and summarise the current evidence, in order to inform and guide diagnosis and management of patients with AIH and its variant syndromes. The main focus is on AIH in adults, but the guidelines should also be relevant to older children and adolescents.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeta-analysis\r\nmeta-analyses and systematic reviews\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Gastroenterol\r\n    Colonoscopy-related adverse events in the 21st century: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis.\r\n This comprehensive meta-analysis provides valuable insights into the global incidence of colonoscopy-related AEs and underscores the imperative need for continuous efforts to enhance the safety of this procedure.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOverall and Cause-Specific Mortality in Patients with Barrett's Esophagus: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Population-Based Studies.\r\n BE patients exhibit a higher all-cause mortality, driven in part by risk of EC mortality. A personalized approach to surveillance, mitigating risk of EC while recognizing the broader mortality risks, is warranted.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Afamin and Apolipoprotein F Associated With Liver Steatosis From People Living With HIV: A Discovery Study.\r\nThese findings suggest that the identified proteins could serve as promising biomarkers of LS in PLWH, paving the way for further investigations into the roles of these proteins in LS development in this unique population.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAssociation of High-Sensitivity Troponins in Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease With All-Cause and Cause-Specific Mortality.\r\n Screening hs-troponin T or I in individuals with MASLD can identify at-risk subpopulations within this group that have a higher risk for future all-cause mortality, predominantly due to cardiovascular disease-related mortality in the population without cardiovascular disease.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLimitations of Faecal Calprotectin in Detecting Histological Changes and Persistent Villous Atrophy in Patients With Coeliac Disease on a Gluten-Free Diet.\r\nAlthough significant histological lesions (Marsh II-III) decreased from 24% to 10%, faecal calprotectin levels fluctuated without correlation to anti-transglutaminase, adherence or histological remission, and did not differentiate between lesion grades. Our findings underscore faecal calprotectin's unreliability in monitoring mucosal healing in adults with coeliac disease, highlighting the urgent need for alternative biomarkers.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAm J Gastroenterol\r\n    ALADDIN: A Machine Learning Approach to Enhance the Prediction of Significant Fibrosis or Higher in MASLD.\r\nAlong with the SAFE model developed to target significant fibrosis or higher, ALADDIN-F2-VCTE ( uniquely supports a refined non-invasive approach to patient selection for resmetirom without the need for liver biopsy. Additionally, ALADDIN-F2-Lab ( offers an effective alternative when VCTE is unavailable.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAssociation of Components of Metabolic Syndrome and the Progression of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.\r\n In the cohort of NAFLD patients, MetS was associated with greater histological severity at baseline but was not a risk factor for disease progression or regression.

Further research is needed to identify and address modifiable patient, clinician, and healthcare system barriers to achieve health equity in the management of inflammatory bowel disease.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nChanges in gastroenterology service volumes and billing patterns associated with declining Medicare reimbursement.\r\n Within Medicare, decreasing procedural reimbursement is associated with decreased procedural volumes and fewer participating gastroenterologists.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCharacteristics of post-polypectomy colorectal cancer events and deaths.\r\nMost PPCRC events and deaths were diagnosed before the next recommended exam, largely due to procedural factors, underscoring the need to optimize quality of baseline colonoscopy and polypectomy. Many PPCRCs were diagnosed after recommended exam, suggesting the need to improve patient adherence to recommended surveillance intervals.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastric (Foveolar) Dysplasia in Barrett's Esophagus: A Clinical, Molecular and Long-Term Outcome Study.\r\n Gastric type dysplasia is common in BE. Our study suggests that this type of dysplasia may represent a more aggressive form of neoplastic precursor than conventional intestinal type dysplasia.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIncidence and survival of colorectal cancer in the United Kingdom from 2000-2021: a population-based cohort study.\r\n Although the overall incidence in the population has plateaued, a worrying increasing trend of early-onset CRC was observed. Moreover, the slight improvement in overall survival suggests that significant progress is still needed. These findings highlight the urgent need for continued research and resource allocation to improve the diagnosis and management of colorectal cancer.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver Cleansing Imposters: An Analysis Of Popular Online Liver Supplements.\r\nThis study reveals a thriving market for liver supplements despite limited scientific evidence supporting their efficacy. The prevalence of bold health claims, high consumer satisfaction, and significant sales highlight the need for more rigorous evaluation and regulation of these products. Healthcare providers should be aware of these trends to better counsel patients on evidence-based approaches to liver health.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLoss of response to off-label swallowed topical corticosteroids in eosinophilic esophagitis can be overcome by a switch to an esophageal-targeted budesonide formulation.\r\n Most patients non-responding to olSTC are not true corticosteroid-refractory but respond to an esophageal-targeted budesonide formulation. Age below 30 years, longer treatment duration and low adherence are associated with olSTC-failure.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRaising the age for starting colonoscopy to 35 years for individuals with path_MSH6 carriers may lead to missed opportunities for detecting advanced neoplasia in a notable percentage of carriers.\r\n Our findings suggest that the recommendation to raise the age for initiating colonoscopy to 35 years for path_MSH6 carriers merits careful consideration, as there is a possibility that AN may not be detected. Given the limited size of our study and the potential for ascertainment bias, we encourage further research to explore and validate our findings.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRisk of Colorectal Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection in Older Adults: A Nationwide Study in Japan.\r\nThe risks of AEs during colorectal ESD increase with age, particularly in patients aged ≥85 years.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSafety and Efficacy of Endoscopic Retrograde Appendicitis Therapy for pediatric patients: A Single-Center Retrospective Study in Chinese Children.\r\nERAT appears to be a safe and effective alternative approach to treat appendicitis in pediatric patients, especially for obstructive appendicitis with appendicolith.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTraining and Performance of an Electrocardiogram-enabled Machine Learning Model for Detection of Advanced Chronic Liver Disease.\r\n An ECG-enabled ML model affords great promise in identifying advanced CLD in low resource areas.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopy\r\n    Peroral endoscopic myotomy for symptomatic blown-out myotomy following previous myotomy for achalasia.\r\nClinical success was equivalent between the two groups at the 2-year follow-up (85.7% vs 92.3%;  = 0.16). Based on this study, POEM could be considered as an effective treatment option for patients with symptomatic BOM.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nProton pump inhibitors are associated with occlusion of lumen-apposing metal stents and higher frequency of endoscopic necrosectomies - A European-wide multicenter cohort study.\r\n Intake of PPIs upon LAMS placement is associated with a higher LAMS occlusion and necrosectomy rate.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    AI-Enabled Clinical Trials in IBD: Automating and Enhancing Disease Assessment and Study Management.\r\nLarge language models and generative AI are automating the collection of high-quality data from electronic records and improving our ability to predict patient outcomes.

Use of IUS monitoring antenatally should be considered to guide therapeutic decision making.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nStromal Stiffness-Regulated IGF2BP2 in Pancreatic Cancer Drives Immune Evasion via Sphingomyelin Metabolism.\r\n These findings emphasize the critical interplay between extrinsic matrix stiffness and intrinsic IGF2BP2-regulated sphingomyelin synthesis, identifying a promising target for immunotherapeutic strategies in PDAC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    Risk of post-ERCP pancreatitis due to placement of biliary self-expandable metal stents (SEMS): a single-center retrospective study.\r\nAt our center, SEMS placement was found to be an independent risk factor for the development of PEP.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    Combining faecal haemoglobin, iron deficiency anaemia status and age can improve colorectal cancer risk prediction in patients attending primary care with bowel symptoms: a retrospective observational study.\r\n Combining f-Hb, patient age and IDA status improves CRC risk prediction, identifies a low-risk group with f-Hb<20 µg Hb/g and no IDA and could inform revised referral guidance.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nStressed hepatocyte sustains alcohol-associated hepatitis progression by producing leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 2.\r\n Our studies identified a novel vicious cycle between neutrophils and hepatocytes through the LECT2-PHB2 interaction, presenting a promising therapeutic intervention by targeting LECT2 to mitigate AH in patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTumour-intrinsic alterations and stromal matrix remodelling promote Wnt-niche independence during diffuse-type gastric cancer progression.\r\nOur findings demonstrate that tumour cell-derived ligand expression and extracellular matrix remodelling sustain Wnt signalling during DGC progression. These complementary mechanisms promote niche independence enabling expansion of undifferentiated DGC cells needed for the development of advanced tumours.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    Comparative effectiveness of immunotherapy versus lenvatinib in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: A real-world analysis using target trial emulation.\r\nIn this real-world analysis, immunotherapy was associated with improved OS compared to lenvatinib in advanced HCC, with consistent benefit across most subgroups. These findings support the use of immunotherapy as a first-line treatment for advanced HCC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEpidemiological and economical burden of cholestatic liver disease.\r\nAn accurate understanding of the epidemiology and burden of disease on both the individual and society of cholestatic diseases is of great importance. This review aims at providing a comprehensive overview of the current literature on the epidemiology, health related quality of life, and economical burden of PSC, PBC, and IgG4-C.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGetting to HBV Cure - will new biomarkers help?\r\nIn this review, the serological, virological and immunological biomarkers are described with a focus on how they can be used to guide development of HBV cure strategies. New terminology is proposed for clinical endpoints, including Sustained Control to replace the concept of partial cure and Resolved Chronic Infection to replace Functional Cure, reserving the term Cure for clearance or silencing of al cccDNA and integrated HBV DNA.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Cause-specific mortality in 13,099 patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease in Sweden.\r\nMASLD was strongly associated with liver- and HCC-related mortality, but the absolute risks of death were highest for non-HCC cancer and cardiovascular disease. Mortality was increased for nearly al causes in patients with MASLD, suggesting that earlier multidisciplinary care is needed to reduce excess mortality. Impact and implications Previous studies on mortality in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) were either small, restricted to liver-related mortality, relying on liver biopsy to identify patients and thus inducing selection bias, or mainly using data from old cohorts. In a nationwide cohort study of al patients diagnosed with MASLD in inpatient or specialized outpatient care in Sweden between 2002 and 2020, we found a nearly doubled all-cause mortality rate and higher mortality than the general population from a wide range of causes, indicating that earlier multidisciplinary care may be needed to reduce premature mortality in patients with MASLD. The absolute risk estimates of death in our study may be useful for clinicians and policymakers to inform patients about their prognosis and potentially implement clinical or public health strategies to reduce premature mortality.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHealth-related quality of life in participants with advanced biliary tract cancer from the randomized phase III KEYNOTE-966 study.\r\n HRQoL was maintained after adding pembrolizumab to gemcitabine and cisplatin, further supporting this regimen as first-line treatment for advanced BTC. Impact and implications Biliary tract cancer (BTC) is often diagnosed at late stages because most patients do not present with disease-specific symptoms. Compared with the general population, patients with advanced BTC report worse physical, emotional, and functional well-being. In KEYNOTE-966, adding the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor pembrolizumab to gemcitabine and cisplatin as first-line therapy for participants with advanced BTC produced a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival. The prespecified patient-reported outcomes results from KEYNOTE-966 presented herein demonstrated that health-related quality of life was maintained after adding pembrolizumab to gemcitabine and cisplatin, further supporting this regimen as first-line treatment for advanced BTC. Clinical trial registration\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiposomal irinotecan for previously treated patients with biliary tract cancer: A pooled analysis of NIFTY and NALIRICC trials.\r\n The addition of nal-IRI to 5-FU/LV significantly improved PFS and ORR, supporting its potential as subsequent-line therapy. Differences in safety profiles underscore the relevance of ethnicity for nal-IRI in patients with BTC. Impact and implications Current standard of care for second-line therapy in patients with advanced biliary tract cancer (BTC) is FOLFOX. This study provides robust evidence supporting the potential role of additional liposomal irinotecan (nal-IRI) to fluorouracil and leucovorin (5-FU/LV) as a subsequent therapy for patients with BTC who have progressed on gemcitabine-based regimens. The findings demonstrate significant improvements in progression-free survival and overall response rates, emphasizing its potential to address the limited treatment options in this patient population. Furthermore, the study underscores the necessity of considering ethnic differences in adverse event profiles to optimize treatment administration and patient outcomes.

We will highlight the critical role of clinicians in promoting the public health policies, widespread screening for AUD and for ALD, and integrating liver with addiction care for patients with ALD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPregnancy tTG-IgA seropositivity and maternal and infant health in the Child Health and Development Studies.\r\ntTG-IgA seropositivity was associated with the presence of two or more markers of celiac comorbidity. Offspring exposed to maternal seropositivity had poorer fetal growth and lower infant weight gain. Findings support the potential beneficial role of tTG-IgA screening during pregnancy, both for the pregnant woman and exposed offspring.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopy\r\n    Colorectal cancer incidence following a negative colonoscopy in fecal immunochemical test-based screening: a nationwide cohort study after 8 years of screening in Denmark.\r\nHowever, the lower risk might not justify 8 years of quarantine, especially for women and younger age groups. Individualized screening is warranted and transfer of evidence from non-FIT screening should be done carefully.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRecurrences after piecemeal endoscopic mucosal resection of 10-20mm non-pedunculated colorectal polyps: a multicenter cohort study.\r\nThis real-world study found a substantial recurrence rate at ESC following pEMR of 10-20mm NPCPs. ESC scar identification was moderate but improved with tattoo placement. Although early surveillance could be considered to avoid missing recurrences, the small recurrence size and absence of high-grade dysplasia suggest that modestly extending the interval beyond that of our study may still allow timely detection of recurrences and metachronous lesions.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Clinical Implementation of Artificial Intelligence in Gastroenterology: Current Landscape, Regulatory Challenges, and Ethical Issues.\r\nEthical and medicolegal concerns exist relating to data governance, patient harm, liability and bias.

Here we discuss the state of the art, potential, and limits, of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the multi-omics approach to gut microbiome.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPerforin Generated by CD8+ T Cells Exacerbates IBD-Induced Depression by Promoting CXCL9 Production in Intestinal Epithelial Cells. \r\nNeutralizing CXCL9 in vivo alleviated depression but had no effect on colitis in mice. Perforin generated by colonic CD8+ T cells promotes intestinal epithelial cell CXCL9 production, which leads to neuronal ER stress in hippocampus and induces depression in IBD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSystemic identification of functionally conserved lncRNA metabolic regulators in human and mouse livers.\r\nOur study supports that fcLMRs represent a novel and prevalent biological phenomenon, and deep phenotyping of genetic mLMR mouse models constitutes a powerful approach to understand the pathophysiological role of lncRNAs in the human liver.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe efficacy of texture and color enhancement imaging (TXI) observation in the detection of colorectal lesions: a multicenter, randomized controlled trial (deTXIon study).\r\nThis study did not demonstrate the superiority of TXI over WLI in detecting neoplastic lesions. However, TXI may be effective in detecting flat polyps.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    EUS fine-needle biopsy of solid pancreatic masses with and without rapid on-site evaluation for commercial next generation genomic profiling. \r\nHowever, compared with FNB without ROSE, FNB with ROSE required more than double the procedure time (mean (SD): 21.1 (10) vs 49.7 (20.6) min, p<0.001) and significantly higher number of median needle passes (3 (IQR 2-3) vs 4 (IQR 3-4), p<0.001). While EUS-FNB with ROSE did not have significantly different adequacy for commercial genomic analysis compared to EUS without ROSE, it required significantly more procedure time and needle passes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFrequency and Predictors of Delayed Clearance of Prophylactic Pancreatic Stents following ERCP. \r\nProphylactic PS was cleared within 4 weeks in only half of the patients following ERCP. In addition to primarily endoscopist-driven factors, biliary stent placement was associated with delayed clearance of prophylactic PS.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRandomized Trial Comparing the Franseen Needle Versus Two Types of Sharpened-Tip Three-Prong Needles in Endoscopic Ultrasound-Guided Tissue Acquisition from Solid Pancreatic Lesions. \r\nThe conventional FNB needle demonstrated a higher tissue-collection rate but did not surpass the noninferiority margin that was set in this study, with no significant differences in the histological diagnostic performance or the tissue volume between the needles. The superior puncture performance of the novel needles suggests their particular benefit in challenging cases or for less experienced endoscopists.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Burden and Cost of Post-ERCP Pancreatitis Among Commercially Insured People Undergoing ERCP. \r\nThe population-level cost of post-ERCP pancreatitis ranged from $85,833,757 to 432,648,810 across a range of reported estimates for post-ERCP pancreatitis and annual ERCP volume in the US. Post-ERCP pancreatitis is relatively uncommon, occurring in 5-6% of individuals, but results in substantial financial burden.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    Diagnostic efficacy of an extracellular vesicle-derived lncRNA-based liquid biopsy signature for the early detection of early-onset gastric cancer.\r\nThe newly developed EV-lncRNA signature effectively identified EOGC patients at a resectable stage with enhanced precision, thereby improving the prognosis of patients who would have otherwise missed the curative treatment window.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDietary whey protein protects against Crohn's disease by orchestrating cross-kingdom interaction between the gut phageome and bacteriome. \r\nImportantly, we uncovered a beneficial dietary WP, a keystone phage AkkZT003P, and a probiotic S. thermophilus that can be used in CD management in the future.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndothelial-like cancer-associated fibroblasts facilitate pancreatic cancer metastasis via vasculogenic mimicry and paracrine signalling. \r\nFAPα+CD144+endoCAFs can promote metastasis of PDAC via undertaking VM and paracrine through activation of the CD144-β-catenin-STAT3 signalling axis. CAF-targeting siRNA delivery nanosystem can inhibit tumour progression by precisely targeting FAPα+CD144+endoCAFs.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLongitudinal paired liver biopsies and transcriptome profiling in alcohol-associated hepatitis reveal dynamic changes in cellular senescence. \r\nOur in vitro model revealed that ethanol directly induces senescence and was dependent on ethanol metabolism. Our results suggest a possible pathogenic role for senescence in AH and indicate cellular senescence as a potential therapeutic target in early ALD to limit AH severity.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRectal diclofenac versus indomethacin for prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis (DIPPP): a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial.\r\n Pre-procedure 100 mg rectal diclofenac was not superior to the same dose of rectal indomethacin regarding preventing PEP. These findings supported current clinical practice guidelines of 100 mg indomethacin or diclofenac for PEP prophylaxis in patients without contraindications.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    Associations between metabolic syndrome and cholangiocarcinoma risk: A large-scale population-based cohort study.\r\nThe positive association between metabolic syndrome and cholangiocarcinoma risk suggests that managing metabolic risk factors might reduce the occurrence of both intra- and extra-hepatic cholangiocarcinoma.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDeep learning analysis of magnetic resonance imaging accurately detects early-stage perihilar cholangiocarcinoma in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis.\r\n The 3D DenseNet-121 MRI model effectively detects early-stage pCCA in PSC patients.

Particularly, among immune-tolerant patients, HBsAg levels ≥10,000 IU/mL showed delayed development of HCC, suggesting HBsAg as a biomarker to define genuine immune-tolerant patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNeutrophil serine proteases NE and PR3 controlled by the miR-223/STAT3 axis potentiate MASH and liver fibrosis.\r\nOur findings reveal that NE and PR3 are key factors triggering liver inflammation to potentiate the development of MASH and liver fibrosis, offering insight into the development of new therapeutic approaches that target NE and PR3.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nProton density fat fraction for diagnosis of metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease. \r\nPDFF was the most accurate single classifier for diagnosing MASLD, MASH, and fibrotic MASH. The most accurate multivariable classification models for MASLD, MASH, and fibrotic MASH included PDFF, demonstrating the central importance of PDFF for noninvasive assessment of the MASLD spectrum.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Liver Transplant Comorbidity Index (LTCI) : A composite index of ambulatory Pre-LT factors to identify patients at increased risk of Post-LT Mortality. \r\nThe LTCI, comprising 5 pre-transplant clinical parameters, effectively identifies patients at increased risk of post-transplant mortality. By integrating frailty in the context of other co-morbidities, the LTCI can help providers better weigh the relative transplant risks and benefits and standardize selection of transplant candidates.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Effect of albumin treatment duration on response rates and outcomes in patients with cirrhosis and acute kidney injury.\r\n A substantial proportion of patients requires 48 hours to respond to albumin treatment. Shortening time of albumin therapy may lead to overtreatment with terlipressin. Impact and implications This study provides valuable insights into the optimal duration of albumin treatment for patients with cirrhosis and acute kidney injury (AKI), challenging the recent recommendation of shortening the treatment period with albumin. Furthermore, the optimal definition for response to albumin (reduction of at least one AKI stage) has been assessed. The results of this study are highly clinically relevant since shortening albumin therapy may lead to overtreatment with terlipressin, and evidence to support the choice of the definition of response to albumin was lacking.

However, TXI may be effective in detecting flat polyps.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    Diagnostic efficacy of an extracellular vesicle-derived lncRNA-based liquid biopsy signature for the early detection of early-onset gastric cancer. \r\nThe low levels of this biomarker in postsurgery and other gastrointestinal tumour plasma samples indicated its GC specificity. The newly developed EV-lncRNA signature effectively identified EOGC patients at a resectable stage with enhanced precision, thereby improving the prognosis of patients who would have otherwise missed the curative treatment window.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRectal diclofenac versus indomethacin for prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis (DIPPP): a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial. \r\nClinicalTrials. gov (NCT05947461).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    Deep learning analysis of magnetic resonance imaging accurately detects early-stage perihilar cholangiocarcinoma in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. \r\nThe 3D DenseNet-121 MRI model effectively detects early-stage pCCA in PSC patients. Compared to expert radiologists, the model missed fewer cases of cancer.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHLA-DQB1*03:01 and risk of Hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma.\r\nHLA-DQB1*03 01 and its three key amino acids are associated with an increased HBV-related HCC risk. This association may be explained by the low binding affinity to HBV antigen, resulting in poor control of viral load and increased inflammation, as evidenced by sPD-1 levels.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHigher level of Hepatitis B Surface antigen associated with delayed development of hepatocellular carcinoma in immune-tolerant patients. \r\nPredictive roles of HBV DNA and HBsAg levels in HCC development differ between HBeAg-negative and HBeAg-positive patients. Particularly, among immune-tolerant patients, HBsAg levels ≥10,000 IU/mL showed delayed development of HCC, suggesting HBsAg as a biomarker to define genuine immune-tolerant patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPopulation perspectives on benefits and harms of screening for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. \r\n  This population-based survey demonstrates that the perceived benefits of proactive MASLD screening, such as increased awareness, lifestyle changes, and early diagnosis, outweigh the harms. These findings highlight the importance of early screening through patient-centered protocols to improve health outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPre-B-Cell leukemia transcription factor 1 contributes to liver fibrosis by enabling IL-7 signaling in hepatic stellate cells.\r\nOur data uncover a previously unappreciated role for PBX1 in HSC activation and provide proof-of-concept for targeting IL-7 signaling in the intervention of liver fibrosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Norway rat hepacivirus resembles hepatitis C virus in terms of intra-host evolution and escape from neutralizing antibodies.\r\nThis study demonstrates the correlation between nAbs and viral evolution during long-term NrHV infection. The observed humoral immunity for NrHV infection closely resembles that of chronic HCV infection, where late-emerging high-level nAbs fail to clear evolving viral populations, thereby contributing to the evasion of the adaptive immune response. Preexisting antibodies do, however, protect from infection.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSimultaneous liver transplant and sleeve gastrectomy provides durable weight loss, improves metabolic syndrome and reduces allograft steatosis.\r\nLTSG results in sustained weight loss, resolution of diabetes and hypertension, and reduced recurrence of steatosis and possibly fibrosis compared to LT alone. It confers no increase in mortality or graft loss.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Editorial: Can We Prevent Inflammatory Bowel Disease? \r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Coeliac Disease and Women's Reproductive Health: A Lifelong Challenge. \r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Linking Overt Hepatic Encephalopathy Post-TIPS to Mortality! \r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Prevalence of Suspected Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease in Adolescents in the United States Using Updated Diagnostic Criteria. \r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    A comprehensive review of geriatric syndromes and assessment in older adults with inflammatory bowel diseases.\r\nGeriatric syndromes are prevalent and negatively impact older patients with IBD.
