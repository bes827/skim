Data is limited as consensus definitions have been lacking. Establishing a standardized definition and therapeutic recommendations provides a framework for future studies focusing on epidemiologic and symptoms-based outcomes. Further studies are needed to confirm and refine these recommendations.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the diagnosis and management of cholangiocarcinoma.\r\nQuality of evidence is presented using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) format. The recommendations arising are to be used as guidance rather than as a strict protocol-based reference, as the management of patients with CCA is often complex and always requires individual patient-centred considerations.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeta-analysis\r\nmeta-analyses and systematic reviews\r\n\r\n\r\n    Gut\r\n    Changing prevalence of chronic hepatitis B virus infection in China between 1973 and 2021: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of 3740 studies and 231 million people.\r\nChina has experienced remarkable decreases in HBV infection over the last four decades, but variations in HBsAg prevalence persist in subpopulations. Ongoing prevention of HBV transmission is needed to meet HBV elimination targets by 2030.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    Pre-emptive TIPS in high-risk acute variceal bleeding. An updated and revised individual patient data meta-analysis.\r\nThe updated two-stage IPD-MA confirms the significant survival advantage of p-TIPS in high-risk patients with cirrhosis and AVB. As a result, we recommend p-TIPS as the preferred first-choice treatment for these patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Antibiotic use as a risk factor for irritable bowel syndrome: Results from a nationwide, case-control study.\r\nPrior antibiotics use was associated with an increased odds of IBS with the highest risk among people with multiple antibiotics dispensations.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDesign of the phase 3 MAESTRO clinical program to evaluate resmetirom for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.\r\n The MAESTRO clinical programme was designed in conjunction with regulatory authorities to support approval of resmetirom for treatment of NASH. The surrogate endpoints, based on week 52 liver biopsy, serum biomarkers and imaging, are confirmed by long-term clinical liver-related outcomes in MAESTRO-NASH (month 54) and MAESTRO-NASH-OUTCOMES (time to event).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIn severe alcohol-related hepatitis, acute kidney injury is prevalent, associated with mortality independent of liver disease severity, and can be predicted using IL-8 and micro-RNAs.\r\nIncident AKI is associated with 90-day mortality independent of liver function. Prednisolone therapy was associated with reduced incident AKI. IL-8 and several miRNAs are potential biomarkers to predict AKI. Novel therapies to prevent incident AKI should be evaluated in AH to reduce mortality.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNovel symptom clusters predict disease impact and healthcare utilisation in inflammatory bowel disease: Prospective longitudinal follow-up study.\r\nNovel model-based clusters identify patients with IBD at higher risk of adverse disease outcomes who are high-volume users of healthcare.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPeriodontal disease is not associated with risk of inflammatory bowel disease: Results from two prospective cohort studies in the US.\r\n In two large prospective cohort studies, we did not observe an association between periodontal disease and tooth loss and risk of CD or UC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nProspective comparison of diagnostic tests for bile acid diarrhoea.\r\nDiagnosis of bile acid diarrhoea using empirical treatment was inadequate. Exploration suggested considerable improvements in the sensitivity of C4-based testing, offering potential widely available diagnostics. Further validation is warranted.   NCT03876717.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTherapeutic drug monitoring of methotrexate in patients with Crohn's disease.\r\nFive patients ended study participation or stopped methotrexate for another reason. A higher MTX-PG could be used for TDM if a target concentration can be established.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAm J Gastroenterol\r\n    A Predictive Model to Identify the Effects of Transcutaneous Sacral Nerve Stimulation with Pelvic Floor Exercises in Faecal Incontinence after Surgery for Anorectal Malformation.\r\ntSNS with PFEs is effective for most FI patients after CARM surgery except when rectum deviates from the puborectal muscle centre, puborectal muscle rupture occurs, or EAS is absent with a low ASP.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nADALIMUMAB VERSUS INFLIXIMAB IN LUMINAL PEDIATRIC CROHN'S DISEASE: COMPARABLE OUTCOMES IN A PROSPECTIVE MULTICENTER COHORT STUDY.\r\n Children with Crohn's disease achieved favourable outcomes at one year with either ADA or IFX as first antiTNF agents. Those receiving IFX did not have significantly superior outcomes compared to clinically similar children receiving ADA.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAdditional 30-second observation of the right-sided colon for missed polyp detection with texture and color enhancement imaging compared to narrow band imaging: A randomized trial.\r\n Regarding add-30-s observation of the right-sided colon, TXI was non-inferior to NBI.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClinical features and treatment response to topical steroids in ethnic and racial minority patients with eosinophilic esophagitis.\r\n Few EoE patients at our center were Hispanic, and they had similar clinical presentations as non-Hispanics. The non-White EoE group was larger, and presentation was less dysphagia-specific. Non-White patients were also less than half as likely to respond to tCS.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClinical outcomes after endoscopic management of low-risk and high-risk T1a esophageal adenocarcinoma: A multicenter study.\r\n High-risk T1a EAC patients undergoing successful EET had a substantially higher rate of extra-esophageal metastases compared to low-risk T1a EAC on long term follow-up. These data should be factored into discussions with patients while selecting treatment approaches. Additional prospective data in this area are critical.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nColorectal cancer screening receipt does not differ by 10-year mortality risk among older adults.\r\n Past-year CRC screening does not differ by predicted 10-year mortality risk. An age-based approach to CRC screening results in under-screening of older, healthier adults and over-screening of younger adults with chronic conditions. Personalized screening with incorporation of individual life expectancy may increase the value of CRC screening programs.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCorrelations Between Relative Prevalence of Celiac Disease and Sociodemographic Variables in the United States.\r\n CD relative prevalence is associated with indicators of economic advantage.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastric Alimetry® expands patient phenotyping in gastroduodenal disorders compared to gastric emptying scintigraphy.\r\nGA improves patient phenotyping in chronic gastroduodenal disorders in the presence and absence of motility abnormalities with increased correlation with symptoms and psychometrics compared to gastric emptying status and Rome IV criteria. These findings have implications for the diagnostic profiling and personalized management of gastroduodenal disorders.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMaternal and Neonatal Outcomes in Vedolizumab and Ustekinumab Exposed Pregnancies: Results from the PIANO registry.\r\n This analysis of UST and VDZ exposure during pregnancy suggests no increase in complications compared to TNFs, immunomodulators and combination TNFs/immunomodulators. No signal was found for increased placental events with either therapy. Continuation of UST and VDZ throughout pregnancy is recommended.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOPTIMIZING TIMING OF FOLLOW-UP COLONOSCOPY: A PILOT CLUSTER RANDOMIZED TRIAL OF A KNOWLEDGE TRANSLATION TOOL.\r\n An application that provides colonoscopy surveillance intervals may help endoscopists with guideline congruence, especially those with a lower pre-intervention congruence with guideline recommendations. (ClincialTrials.gov number, NCT04889352).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOutcomes of a 3-year prospective surveillance in individuals at high-risk for pancreatic cancer.\r\n PC surveillance in a fully public healthcare system is feasible, safe, and leads to early PC or pre-malignant lesions diagnoses, mostly at baseline but also over time.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPandemic-related changes in incidence and mortality rates of gastrointestinal cancers during 2020.\r\n Incidence and mortality rates of GI cancers may increase in the future given pandemic-related delays in 2020.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF BARRETT'S ESOPHAGUS AND RELATED DYSPLASIA DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.\r\nThere was a significant decline in the number of BE and BE-related dysplasia diagnoses during the COVID-19 pandemic, with an almost 50% reduction in the amount of dysplasia diagnosed in the early pandemic. The absence of a compensatory increase in diagnoses in the pandemic-Phase II and III periods may result in deleterious downstream effects on esophageal adenocarcinoma morbidity and mortality.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSatisfaction with life in IBS is associated with psychological burden rather than gastrointestinal symptom severity.\r\nHigher physical and mental quality of life, but not gastrointestinal symptom severity, were independently associated with higher general life satisfaction in IBS. These findings reinforce the clinical need in IBS treatment to focus on the full extent of the disorder and not merely on gastrointestinal symptom improvement. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier  NCT00775060.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Association between Homelessness and Key Liver-Related Outcomes in Veterans with Cirrhosis.\r\nHomelessness in veterans with cirrhosis is associated with increased all-cause mortality, however this is likely mediated primarily through non-liver-related factors. Future studies are needed to explore drivers of mortality and improve mitigation strategies in these patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Impact of Patient's Primary Language on Inpatient Gastrointestinal Bleeding Outcomes.\r\n Disparities exist in GIB outcomes among patients with PLOE but these gaps narrow at hospitals with higher percentages of PLOE patients. Cultural and linguistic competence may improve outcomes in this vulnerable group.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTranscutaneous auricular vagal nerve stimulation is effective for the treatment of functional dyspepsia: a multicenter, randomized controlled study.\r\n Our study firstly showed that 4-week taVNS (both 10Hz and 25Hz) was effective and safe for the treatment of adult FD. (clinicaltrials.gov number  NCT04668534).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopy\r\n    Forced cold snare polypectomy is related to cold snare defect protrusions and incomplete polyp resections: A prospective observational study.\r\nFCSP was performed on 105 polyps (8%) in this study. There is the possibility that FCSP is associated with the occurrence of CSDPs and IPR. Further studies are necessary in the future to confirm our results.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInterval post-colonoscopy colorectal cancer following a negative colonoscopy in a fecal immunochemical test-based screening program.\r\n  Risk of iPCCRC within a FIT-based CRC screening program was low during the first years after colonos-copy but, after 2.5 years, was the same as the risk in FIT-negative individuals at 2 years, when they are reinvited for screening. Colonoscopy quality may therefore require further improvement and FIT screening interval may need to be reduced after negative colonoscopy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Geometry of Cold Snare Polypectomy.\r\n RER is more important with p-CSP than with HSP. RER and consequent RIR increases with increasing polyp size. Given the overwhelming safety of CSP, specific techniques to minimise the RER should be studied and developed.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    HBV DNA AND HBSAG LEVELS AT 24 WEEKS OFF-TREATMENT PREDICT CLINICAL RELAPSE AND HBSAG LOSS IN HBEAG NEGATIVE PATIENTS WHO DISCONTINUED ANTIVIRAL THERAPY.\r\nAmong HBeAg negative CHB patients who discontinued antiviral therapy and who did not experience clinical relapse before FU W24, serum levels of HBV DNA and HBsAg at FU W24 can be used to predict subsequent clinical relapse and HBsAg clearance. A combination of HBsAg <100 IU/mL with HBV DNA <100 IU/mL identifies patients with a low risk of relapse and excellent chances of HBsAg loss, and could potentially be used as an early surrogate endpoint for studies aiming at finite therapy in HBV.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    Impact of surgery after endoscopically resected high-risk T1 colorectal cancer: results of an emulated target trial.\r\nOur study suggests that patients with high-risk T1 CRC initially treated with endoscopic resection may not benefit from additional surgery.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nProspective study of diagnostic yields of flexible spectral imaging color enhancement installed in colon capsule endoscopy for colorectal polyps and tumors.\r\nCCE-FICE improved the detection rates for al CRTs except adenocarcinomas, =10 mm and protruding polyps, when compared to CCE-WL (UMIN 000021125).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSex Differences Impact Ergonomic Endoscopic Training for Gastroenterology Fellows.\r\n Physical differences exist between male and female trainees, and current endoscopic equipment may not be optimized for smaller hand sizes.

The objective of this review is to summarize the mechanism of action of incretin receptor agonists, their effects in the gastrointestinal tract, and implications in clinical practice, particularly in the practice of gastroenterology, endoscopy, and surgery.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOptimizing the management algorithm for adults with functional constipation failing a fiber/laxative trial in general gastroenterology: Cost-effectiveness and cost-minimization analysis.\r\n Anorectal function testing appears to be an emergent technology to optimize cost-effective outcomes, overcoming testing costs by phenotyping care.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOsteoporosis and fragility fractures in patients with cirrhosis evaluated for liver transplantation: Identification of high-risk patients based on computed tomography at evaluation.\r\n In cirrhotic patients evaluated for LT, CT scan identified persons with severe osteoporosis without additional costs.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPoor subjective sleep quality predicts symptoms in Irritable Bowel Syndrome using the Experience Sampling Method.\r\nPoor subjective sleep quality was associated with higher next day lower GI symptom levels, but not vice versa. Objective sleep measures did not predict next day abdominal symptoms, potentially supporting the conclusion that it is the perception of sleep quality which is most influential. This study may be used to guide future research into the effect of sleep interventions on GI symptoms.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPrognostic value of the modified Rutgeerts' score for long-term outcomes after primary ileocecal resection in Crohn's disease.\r\n The increasing mRS corresponds closely with the risk for surgical and clinical recurrence. An index mRS = i2b is associated with surgical recurrence, an index mRS = i1 is associated with clinical recurrence and i1 or i2b with progression to severe endoscopic recurrence. These results support tight monitoring of disease activity and treatment optimization in patients with ileal lesions, and a more conservative management in patients with anastomotic lesions.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSystematic resection of the visible scar, after incomplete endoscopic resection of rectal neuroendocrine tumours.\r\nIn case of non-R0 resected r-NET, systematic scar resection by EFTR or ESD seems necessary.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nUtility of the Serum-Based Endoscopic Healing Index in Monitoring Therapeutic Response in Ulcerative Colitis.\r\n EHI values are significantly responsive to changes in mucosal inflammation, also in UC patients, and can confirm and/or rule out mucosal inflammation with an almost similar accuracy to that of faecal calprotectin.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    An analysis of delayed bleeding in cases of colorectal endoscopic submucosal dissection due to types of direct oral anticoagulants in Japan.\r\nDabigatran was associated with a higher DBR than other DOACs, and only rivaroxaban was associated with a significantly lower DBR than warfarin.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLong-term Safety Outcomes of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation: Real-World Data over Eight Years from the Hong Kong FMT Registry.\r\n This prospective real-world data from Asia's first FMT registry demonstrated that FMT has an excellent long-term safety profile.

The coexistence between psychological distress/somatic symptoms and DGBI seems to be especially detrimental to quality of life and healthcare utilization. Individuals with psychological distress/somatic symptoms and DGBI coexistence appear to be a group vulnerable to psychosocial problems that should be studied further and would likely benefit from psychological/psychiatric interventions.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMonitoring Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease at High Risk of Anal Cancer.\r\nThis review describes the most recent literature surrounding anal cancer in the IBD population as well as the unique challenges inherent in diagnosing and treating this population. We conclude by proposing a new screening motif based off literature review as well as multidisciplinary clinical experience that aims to increase early detection of anal cancers in the IBD population.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOlder Adult-Onset of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases is Associated With Higher Utilization of Analgesics: A Nationwide Cohort Study.\r\n In this nationwide cohort, older adults most commonly received analgesic prescriptions within 1 year after IBD diagnosis. Additional research is needed to examine the etiology and sequelae of increased analgesic prescribing to this demographic.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOptimizing the management algorithm for adults with functional constipation failing a fiber/laxative trial in general gastroenterology: Cost-effectiveness and cost-minimization analysis.\r\n Anorectal function testing appears to be an emergent technology to optimize cost-effective outcomes, overcoming testing costs by phenotyping care.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOsteoporosis and fragility fractures in patients with cirrhosis evaluated for liver transplantation: Identification of high-risk patients based on computed tomography at evaluation.\r\n In cirrhotic patients evaluated for LT, CT scan identified persons with severe osteoporosis without additional costs.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRandomized trial of prophylactic antibiotics for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in patients with biliary obstruction.\r\nAntibiotic prophylaxis before ERCP in patients with biliary obstruction resulted in a significantly lower risk of infectious complications, especially cholangitis, than placebo (ClinicalTrials.gov trial number NCT02958059).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSystematic resection of the visible scar, after incomplete endoscopic resection of rectal neuroendocrine tumours.\r\nIn case of non-R0 resected r-NET, systematic scar resection by EFTR or ESD seems necessary.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) augmentation and the liver phenotype of adults with AAT deficiency (genotype Pi*ZZ).\r\n The first evaluation of AAT augmentation on the Pi*ZZ-related liver disease indicates liver safety of a widely used treatment for AATD-associated lung disease. Prospective studies are needed to confirm the beneficial effects and to demonstrate the potential efficacy of exogenous AAT in patients with Pi*ZZ-associated liver disease.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLong-term Safety Outcomes of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation: Real-World Data over Eight Years from the Hong Kong FMT Registry.\r\n This prospective real-world data from Asia's first FMT registry demonstrated that FMT has an excellent long-term safety profile. The risk of developing new medical conditions beyond 12 months after FMT is low.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPREVALENCE AND PREDICTORS OF BARRETT'S ESOPHAGUS AFTER NEGATIVE INITIAL ENDOSCOPY: ANALYSIS FROM TWO NATIONAL DATABASES.\r\n In this study of >350,000 patients, rates of BE on repeat EGD ranged from 1.7-3.4%, and were higher in those with multiple risk factors. Most were likely missed at initial evaluation, underscoring the importance of a high-quality initial endoscopic examination. While routine repeat endoscopic BE screening after a negative initial examination, is not recommended, repeat screening may be considered in carefully selected patients with GERD and = 2 risk factors for BE, potentially using non-endoscopic tools.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSex differences in treatment response to nucleos(t)ide therapy in chronic hepatitis B: a multicenter longitudinal study.\r\nSex differences exist for treatment outcomes among hepatitis B patients. Male sex associated with 16% higher likelihood of clinical remission and 31% higher likelihood of biochemical response than females, while viral suppression and HCC incidence were similar between the two groups.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nUse of DPP4 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists and risk of intestinal obstruction: Scandinavian cohort study.\r\nIn this analysis of nationwide data from three Nordic countries, previous safety signals indicating an increased risk of intestinal obstruction with use of DPP4 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists were not confirmed.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndosc Int Open\r\n    Accuracy of polyp characterization by artificial intelligence and endoscopists: a prospective, non-randomized study in a tertiary endoscopy center.\r\nAccuracy for polyp characterization by a new commercially available AI system is high, but does not fulfill the criteria for a \"resect-and-discard\" strategy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEfficacy of a novel integrated biliary stent and nasobiliary catheter system for accidental tube deviation in biliary drainage.\r\nThe UMIDAS NB stent might be useful for biliary drainage in patients with a high risk of NBD tube self-removal.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nTubularization of the gastric pouch helps sustain weight loss after transoral outlet reduction for post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass weight recurrence.\r\nThe tTORe enhances efficacy and durability of the standard procedure without adding significant procedure-related risks.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nEndoscopy\r\n    Patient safety incidents in endoscopy: a human factors analysis of non-procedural significant harm incidents from the National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS).\r\nCONCLUSIONS This was the first national-level human factors analysis of endoscopy-specific PSIs.

Furthermore, we unveil the therapeutic potential of CDK inhibitors such as Palbociclib to reduce T cell exhaustion for future treatment of patients with colorectal cancer.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    ASSOCIATION OF ENDOSCOPIC BIOSPY SAMPLING METHODS WITH DETECTION OF PRECURSOR LESIONS OF GASTRIC CANCER.\r\nThe application of the Sydney protocol is associated with an increased detection of precursor lesions of gastric cancer in routine clinical practice.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nERCP using balloon-assisted endoscope versus EUS-guided treatment for common bile duct stones in Roux-en-Y gastrectomy.\r\nEffectiveness and safety of BE-ERCP and EUS-AG were comparable in CBD stone removal for patients after R-Y gastrectomy, but complete stone removal after technical success was superior in BE-ERCP.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLUMEN APPOSING METAL STENTS WITH OR WITHOUT COAXIAL PLASTIC STENT PLACEMENT FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF PANCREATIC FLUID COLLECTIONS.\r\n In this comparative single-center study, placement of a coaxial DPPS for LAMS drainage of PFCs did not affect rates of AEs or clinical success.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    DNA-methylation signature accurately differentiates pancreatic cancer from chronic pancreatitis in tissue and plasma.\r\n The success of machine-learning to identify an effective marker signature documents the power of this approach. The high diagnostic accuracy of discriminating PDAC from CP could have tremendous consequences for treatment success, once the result from still a limited number of liquid biopsy samples would be confirmed in a larger cohort of patients with suspected pancreatic cancer.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDisruption of CerS6-mediated sphingolipid metabolism by FTO deficiency aggravates ulcerative colitis.\r\nFTO downregulation promoted UC by decreasing CerS6 expression, leading to increased S1P accumulation in IECs and aggravating colitis via m 6 A-dependent mechanisms. Lower FTO expression in UC patients may enhance their response to vedolizumab treatment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEnhanced antitumour immunity following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy mediates a favourable prognosis in women with resected pancreatic cancer.\r\n PDAC tumours of women are more sensitive to gemcitabine-based nCRT, resulting in longer OS after resection compared with men. This may be due to enhanced immunity impeding the infiltration of protumoral M2 macrophages into the TME. Our findings highlight the importance of considering sex disparities and mitigating immunosuppressive macrophage polarisation for personalised PDAC treatment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOptimal measurement of gastric emptying of solids in gastroparesis or functional dyspepsia: evidence to establish standard test.\r\nOur aim was to assess inter-individual and intra-individual coefficients of variation (COV) in GES in symptomatic patients with Gp or FD with documented slow or normal GES, respectively.

APE1-redox function inhibitors can have a therapeutic role in EAC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of Aldafermin in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and compensated cirrhosis.\r\nAldafermin 3 mg resulted in significant reduction in ELF in patients with compensated NASH cirrhosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nBile acid-induced IRF3 phosphorylation mediates cell death, inflammatory responses and fibrosis in cholestasis-induced liver and kidney injury via regulation of ZBP1.\r\nWe discovered that ZBP1 interacted with RIP1, RIP3 and NLRP3, thereby revealing its potential role in regulation of cell death and inflammation pathways. In conclusion, our data indicate that bile acid-induced IRF3 phosphorylation and the IRF3-ZBP1 axis play a central role in the pathogenesis of cholestatic liver and kidney injury.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCanonical Wnt signaling promotes HSC glycolysis and liver fibrosis through an LDH-A/HIF-1a transcriptional complex.\r\nInhibition of HSC glycolysis by targeting Wnt/ß-catenin signaling and LDH-A had therapeutic promise for liver fibrosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nComputational drug prediction in hepatoblastoma by integrating pan-cancer transcriptomics with pharmacological response.\r\nWe also found that in a cohort of 46 patients with HB, high CDK9 tumour expression was significantly associated with poor prognosis. Our work proves the usefulness of computational methods trained on pan-cancer datasets to reposition drugs in rare paediatric cancers such as HB, and to help clinicians in choosing the best treatment options for their patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHigher need for polycystic liver disease therapy in female patients: sex-specific association between liver volume and need for therapy.\r\n Baseline TLV is strongly associated with volume reducing therapy initiation at follow-up in PLD patients, with sex-specific differences in this association. Disease staging systems should use TLV to predict need for future volume reducing therapy in PLD separately for males and females.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHypoxia-driven tumor stromal remodeling and immunosuppressive microenvironment in scirrhous hepatocellular carcinoma.\r\nWe uncovered the genomic characteristics of SHCC, and revealed a hypoxia-driven tumor stroma remodeling and immunosuppressive microenvironment in SHCC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nObesity management for the hepatologist - what to do, how to do it and why.\r\nHepatologists and gastroenterologist need to be actively engaged in the management of obesity. This review provides a detailed approach to this challenging comorbidity.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPhysiologic changes in the hepatopulmonary syndrome before and after liver transplant: A longitudinal and predictor analysis.\r\nWe present the largest and longest longitudinal data analysis in HPS. In addition to rates of physiological decline and improvement before and after liver transplantation, we present novel predictors of PaO2 decline and improvement rates. Our findings enhance understanding of the natural history of HPS and provide pathophysiologic clues. Importantly, they may assist providers in prognostication and prioritization before and after transplant.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRNA nanomedicine in liver diseases.\r\nIn this review, we discuss in-depth the different types of RNA and nanocarriers used for liver targeting along with their specific applications in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, liver fibrosis, and liver cancers. We further highlight the strategies for cell specific delivery and future perspectives in this field of research with the emergence of small activating RNA, circular RNA and RNA base editing approaches.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSpatial proteomics of immune microenvironment in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-associated hepatocellular carcinoma.\r\nOur work provides the first detailed spatial map of single-cell phenotypes and multicellular connections in NASH-HCC. We demonstrate that interactions between MDSCs and TAMs with effector T cells underlie immunosuppression in NASH-HCC and are an actionable target.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSpatial proximity of Tumor-Immune interactions predicts patient outcome in hepatocellular carcinoma.\r\nHighly multiplexed imaging analysis of liver cancer reveals tumor-immune cellular heterogeneity within spatial contexts, such as tumor and CD8+ T cell interactions, which may predict patient survival.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTelomere length and risk of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and cholangiocarcinoma in 63,272 individuals from the general population.\r\n Shorter telomere length is associated with a higher risk of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and cholangiocarcinoma.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Cyclosporine vs. tacrolimus after liver transplantation for primary sclerosing cholangitis - a propensity-score matched intention-to-treat analysis.\r\nTacrolimus is associated with better patient and graft survival rates than cyclosporine and should be the standard calcineurin inhibitor in LT for PSC. Impact and implications The most optimal calcineurin inhibitor to use after liver transplantation in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis has yet to be firmly established. Since randomized trials with long follow-up are unlikely to be performed, multicontinental long-term registry data are essential in informing clinical practices. Our study supports the practice of starting immunosuppression after liver transplantation in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis with tacrolimus instead of cyclosporine. The retrospective registry-based design is a limitation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMachine learning for individualized prediction of hepatocellular carcinoma development after the eradication of hepatitis C virus with antivirals.\r\nWe developed and externally validated an RSF model with good predictive performance for the risk of HCC after an SVR. The application of this novel model is available on the website. This model could provide the data to consider an effective surveillance method. Further studies are needed to make recommendations for surveillance policies tailored to the medical situation in each country. Impact and implications A novel prediction model for HCC occurrence in patients after hepatitis C virus eradication was developed using machine learning algorithms. This model, using seven commonly measured parameters, has been shown to have a good predictive ability for HCC development and could provide a personalized surveillance system.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPAGE-B incorporating moderate HBV DNA levels predicts risk of HCC among patients entering into HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B.\r\nWith a scoring range from 0 to 12 points, a PAGED-B score differentiates the HCC risk. A PAGED-B score significantly differentiates the 5-year HCC risk: low <7 points and high =7 points.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the publisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Crohn's Disease: an Equal Opportunity Burden.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Pathobionts in IBD: Origins, Underlying Mechanisms, and Implications for Clinical Care.\r\nDespite recognizing that pathobionts likely contribute to the pathogenesis of IBD, more work is needed to define their modes of action. Determining whether causal relationships exist between pathobionts and specific disease characteristics could pave the way for improved care for patients, particularly for those not responding to current IBD therapies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    Endoscopic drainage of pancreatic fluid collections: Does hospital volume impact outcomes?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nG-POEM for refractory gastroparesis after gastric pacer placement: moving things forward.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    Smart capsules for sensing and sampling the gut: status, challenges and prospects.\r\nAs a compliment to gut sensing smart capsules, significant amount of effort has been put into the development of robotic capsules to collect tissue biopsy and gut microbiota samples to perform in-depth analysis after capsule retrieval which will be a game changer for gut health diagnosis, and this advancement is also covered in this review.

Hispanics may be a group of concern due to higher rates for ALD- and NAFLD-HCC. HCC etiology varies remarkably and may warrant specific interventions by detailed race-ethnicity.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLoneliness and Depressive Symptoms are High Among Older Adults with Digestive Disease and associated with Lower Perceived Health.\r\n Older adults with a digestive disease were more likely than those without a digestive disease to endorse loneliness and moderate-to-severe depression and these conditions are associated with poor-or-fair health. Gastroenterologists should feel empowered to screen patients for depression and loneliness symptoms and establish care pathways for mental health treatment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOptimizing the management algorithm for heartburn in general gastroenterology: Cost-effectiveness and cost-minimization analysis.\r\n Among patients with heartburn, endoscopy with ambulatory reflux monitoring (OFF-PPI) optimizes cost-effective management by matching treatment to phenotype. When erosive findings are absent, trialing PPI discontinuation is more cost-effective than optimizing PPI.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopy\r\n    A machine learning-based choledocholithiasis prediction tool improves ERCP decision making - a proof of concept study.\r\nA machine learning-based tool was created that provides a real-time, personalized, objective probability of choledocholithiasis and ERCP recommendations. This more accurately directs ERCP use than the existing ASGE and ESGE guidelines and has the potential to reduce morbidity and healthcare costs associated with ERCP or missed choledocholithiasis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopic resection of large anastomotic polyps is safe and effective.\r\nLAPs present unique challenges due to their location overlying an anastomosis. Despite these challenges they can be safely and effectively managed endoscopically without recurrence at endoscopic follow-up.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Antireflux surgery versus antireflux medication and risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma in patients with Barrett's esophagus.\r\n Patients with Barrett's esophagus who undergo antireflux surgery do not seem to have a lower risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma than those using antireflux medication.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nStandardizing Randomized Controlled Trials in Celiac Disease: An International Multidisciplinary Appropriateness Study.\r\n We developed standardized recommendations for clinical trial design, eligibility criteria, outcome measures, gluten challenge, and disease evaluations for RCTs in patients with CeD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTraditional Medicine Pien Tze Huang Suppresses Colorectal Tumorigenesis through Restoring Gut Microbiota and Metabolites.\r\n PZH manipulated gut microbiota and metabolites toward a more favorable profile, improves gut barrier function, and suppresses oncogenic and pro-inflammatory pathways, thereby suppressing colorectal carcinogenesis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    ERCP using balloon-assisted endoscope versus EUS-guided treatment for common bile duct stones in Roux-en-Y gastrectomy. \r\nThe 1-year recurrence rate was 8.3% in both groups. Effectiveness and safety of BE-ERCP and EUS-AG were comparable in CBD stone removal for patients after R-Y gastrectomy, but complete stone removal after technical success was superior in BE-ERCP.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    DNA-methylation signature accurately differentiates pancreatic cancer from chronic pancreatitis in tissue and plasma.\r\n The success of machine-learning to identify an effective marker signature documents the power of this approach. The high diagnostic accuracy of discriminating PDAC from CP could have tremendous consequences for treatment success, once the result from still a limited number of liquid biopsy samples would be confirmed in a larger cohort of patients with suspected pancreatic cancer.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEnhanced antitumour immunity following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy mediates a favourable prognosis in women with resected pancreatic cancer.\r\n PDAC tumours of women are more sensitive to gemcitabine-based nCRT, resulting in longer OS after resection compared with men. This may be due to enhanced immunity impeding the infiltration of protumoral M2 macrophages into the TME. Our findings highlight the importance of considering sex disparities and mitigating immunosuppressive macrophage polarisation for personalised PDAC treatment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    LIM domain only 7 negatively controls non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in the setting of hyperlipidaemia.\r\nThese findings provide proof-of-concept evidence supporting LMO7 as a robust suppressor of NASH in the context of hyperlipidemia, indicating that targeting the LMO7-TRIM47 axis is a promising therapeutic strategy for NASH.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLack of complete biochemical response in autoimmune hepatitis leads to adverse outcome: first report of the IAIHG retrospective registry.\r\n The IAIHG-RR represents the world's largest AIH cohort with moderate-to-good data quality and a relevant number of liver-related events. The registry is a suitable platform for patient selection in future studies. Lack of complete biochemical response to treatment, non-white ethnicity, cirrhosis and PSC-AIH were associated with liver-related death and liver transplantation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPegylated interferon-a for chronic hepatitis B…not ready to be shelved yet! new insights on its role using single-cell transcriptomics.\r\nThe current editorial reviews a recent study related to the in-vivo use of PegIFN-a using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology. PegIFN-a reverts the transcriptome profile of treated samples close to that of the healthy population, diminishing the pro-inflammatory genes and 'inflammatory scores' which will be important for the HBV-cure program.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSingle-cell immune profiling of mouse liver aging reveals Cxcl2+ macrophages recruit neutrophils to aggravate liver injury.\r\nThis in-depth study illustrates that the mechanism of Cxcl2+ macrophage-driven neutrophil activation involves the CXCL2-CXCR2 axis, and provide a potential therapeutic strategy for age-related liver injury.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe rapidly evolving landscape of HCC: Selecting the optimal systemic therapy.\r\nIn addition, predictive biomarkers for successful patients' stratification are yet to be available and constitute the focus of ongoing research. The treatment algorithm is likely to become even more complex since systemic therapeutic approaches are now being translated into earlier stages of the disease, with an impact on the evolution of the sequential treatment of HCC patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    AFP-L3 and DCP Strongly Predict Early Hepatocellular Carcinoma Recurrence After Liver Transplantation.\r\nDual-positivity for AFP-L3 =15% and DCP =7.5 strongly predicted post-LT HCC recurrence. This model could refine LT selection criteria and identify high-risk HCC patients to receive additional LRT with LT on hold until biomarker reduction is achieved.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatic steatosis aggravates atherosclerosis via small extracellular vesicle-mediated inhibition of cellular cholesterol efflux.\r\n Steatotic hepatocytes-derived sEVs promote foam cells formation and facilitate atherogenesis by miR-30a-3p/ABCA1 axis. Targeting and reducing hepatic steatotic sEVs secretion or miR-30a-3p may be potential therapeutic approaches to slow the NAFLD-driven AS progression. Impact and implications The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with atherosclerosis (AS). However, the key molecular mechanism of how NAFLD affects atherosclerosis progression is still unclear. Herein, we identified small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) from steatotic hepatocytes as a trigger to accelerate AS progression. Steatotic hepatocytes-derived sEVs promoted foam cells formation via miR-30a-3p/ABCA1 axis. Our findings not only provide mechanistic insight into NAFLD-driven AS but also provide potential therapeutic targets for AS patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImmunosuppressive CD10+ALPL+ neutrophils promote resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy in HCC by mediating irreversible exhaustion of T cells.\r\nCollectively, our results revealed a fundamental mechanism involving CD10 + ALPL + NEUs for tumor immune escape from durable anti-PD-1 treatment and provided further insights into immunotherapy targets or anti-PD-1 synergistic treatment regimens. Impact and implications Herein, we discovered that tumor cells reprogrammed CD10 + ALPL + NEUs to induce the \"irreversible\" exhaustion of T cells and hence allow the tumors to escape from the intended effects of anti-PD-1 treatment. Our data provided a new theoretical basis for the elucidation of special cell populations and a molecular mechanism underpinning resistance to immunotherapy. Targeting these cells contributed to evaluating indications for immunotherapy and could be looked at as a potentially more effective therapeutic approach.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the publisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Editorial: Less is more for colorectal cancer diagnosis - FIT leads the way.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Unveiling new horizons for liver steatosis genetic variants beyond hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis - exploring the potential of HSD17B13 inhibition.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Cannabinoids and the GI Tract.\r\nThe synthesis and degradation of endocannabinoids, location of cannabinoid (CB) receptors, and cannabinoid mechanisms of action on immune/inflammatory, neuromuscular, and sensory functions in digestive organs are well documented. CB mechanisms, have potential for inflammatory, gastroparesis, and pain disorders;  however, the trials require replication and further understanding of risk-benefit to enhance use of cannabinoids in gastrointestinal diseases.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCrohn's Disease: an Equal Opportunity Burden.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMetabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): a proposed stepwise approach.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous\r\nmisc publications eg case reports, tools of the trade, images of the month, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Pinstripe pattern of esophageal achalasia demonstrated with texture and color enhancement imaging.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopy\r\n    The liver adventures of bariatric endoscopy.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    A MODEL TO ELIMINATE VIRAL HEPATITS INFECTION IN MIGRANTS: A PROSPECTIVE, MULTICENTER STUDY IN SOUTHERN ITALY.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAn unusual case of rectal bleeding and abdominal pain in a young man. \r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAscending to new heights for novel therapeutics for eosinophilic esophagitis.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLong-Standing Symptomatic Fistulizing Perianal Crohn's Disease: Progression beyond inflammation. \r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nProteomic panels for alcohol-associated liver disease: accurate, but different enough from existing clinical tests?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSurvival in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma treated with a new immune checkpoint and anti-angiogenic drug combination.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    Comparing the relative efficacy of therapeutics for eosinophilic oesophagitis: is counting eosinophils the right target?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    December 2023 Hepatology Highlights.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetters&Replies\r\nLetters to the editors and authors’ replies\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Letter: Causal relationship between aspirin and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma remains unproven.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLetter: Muscle thickness measurement using ultrasound-A step closer to the use of body composition analysis in the management of inflammatory bowel disease.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLetter: Safety after cessation of nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis B infection-Authors' reply.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLetter: Safety after cessation of nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis B infection.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Early Detection of Pancreatic Cancer: Considerable Advances, but Still a Long Way to Go.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGLP-1 Receptor Agonist Treatment in Liver Cirrhosis.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Helicobacter pylori Eradication in the United States: A Deeper Exploration of Demographics, Strain Variations, and Clinical Implications.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInvestigating the Causal Relationship between Gut Microbiota and Crohn's Disease: A Mendelian Randomization Study.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nQuestion on the use of BMI = 25 kg/m2 to define obesity to analyze the incidence and risk factors of hepatic steatosis and hepatic fibrosis in the Chinese population.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    Tailoring treatment to the circumstance: reasoning behind metal versus plastic drainage of pancreatic collections - authors' reply.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    99% of patients with NAFLD meet MASLD criteria and natural history is therefore identical.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nChanging from NAFLD trough MAFLD to MASLD: similar prevalence and risk factors in a large Brazilian cohort.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNAFLD to MASLD is wokeism?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
