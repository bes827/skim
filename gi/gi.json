Disparities remain, and MASLD-related liver cancer continues to surge.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMetabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis reduces interferon and macrophage liver gene signatures in patients with chronic hepatitis B.\r\nTranscriptomic profiling of the liver suggests that MASH negatively impacts ISGs expression in the liver of patients with ENEG, which may affect antiviral immune pathways, viral replication and inflammatory responses resulting in an increased risk of advanced fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B. Our study provides valuable insights for guiding future research aimed at developing effective, tailored strategies for managing patients with both conditions. Impact and implications In recent decades, obesity and associated health issues have reached epidemic levels, with steatotic liver disease affecting up to 30% of adults in developed countries, and this trend is also observed among chronic hepatitis B patients. Given the high and rising prevalence of steatotic liver disease and its frequent co-occurrence in chronic hepatitis B patients, it is essential to understand how conditions such as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) impact immune responses in the liver. This study provides unique insights into the impact of MASH on HBV antiviral immune activity in the liver of patients with chronic hepatitis B. The rising number of patients with both conditions affects treatment outcomes and highlights the urgent need for novel, tailored therapeutic strategies. Our study holds significant relevance for guiding future research on developing treatment strategies for patients with both MASH and chronic hepatitis B.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Editorial: Disentangling Early-Life Antibiotics and Infections as Risk Factors for the Development of Childhood IBD.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Food for Thought-Addressing the Nuances of Diet and Mood When Evaluating Dietary Intervention in IBS.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Navigating the Beta-Blocker Dilemma in Advanced Liver Cirrhosis-When Is the Right Time to Discontinue?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Stopping NUCs-When to Restart NUCs for the Best Outcome?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Timely Follow-Up in Cirrhosis: How Does It Work?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nUnderstanding Factors Associated With Abdominal Pain in Ulcerative Colitis-No Surprises But the Usual Suspects Need Greater Attention.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Unveiling the Hidden Cost: Evaluating Financial Implications in the Liver Cancer Screening Paradigm.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    The new horizon of Clostridioides difficile infection treatment.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    The Role of Endoscopy in Pregnancy: A Review.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Is there a safe limit for consumption of alcohol?\r\nWe recognize the need to encourage less consumption of alcohol, particularly in young adults, and in older adults with co-morbid conditions particularly when taking multiple medications.

However, the endoscopic appearance of LyE often mirrors that of EOE. Studies suggest potential associations between LyE and Crohn's disease in children, as well as primary esophageal dysmotility in adults. Notably, our patient has a history of rheumatoid arthritis, a correlation observed in 2 other cases in the literature. While limited literature exists on pityriasis lichenoideschronica with esophageal involvement, specifically presenting as LyE, this singular case underscores the interconnection of these 2 disease processes. These observations raise the possibility of an autoimmune etiology. There is no consensus on the lymphocyte count threshold for diagnosis, a challenge compounded by the rarity of the disease, leading to a lack of definitive guidelines for optimal management.JOURNAL/ajgast/04.03/00000434-202410001-03261/figure1/v/2024-10-11T031912Z/r/image-tiff.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTreatment preference archetypes in eosinophilic esophagitis and their implications for therapy.\r\nWe identified three distinct treatment preference archetypes among individuals with EoE, underscoring the need for personalized treatment strategies, especially for those favoring natural approaches but masking ambivalence, and may be at risk for nonadherence or loss to follow-up.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    High hospitalization rates and risk factors among frail patients with cirrhosis: A 10-year population-based cohort study.\r\n Compensated and decompensated cirrhosis patients with intermediate to severe frailty face a substantially increased odds of annual hospitalizations compared to those with low frailty. Future work should focus on targeted interventions to incorporate routine frailty screenings into cirrhosis care and to ultimately minimize high hospitalization rates.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopy\r\n    A novel endoscopic artificial intelligence system to assist in the diagnosis of autoimmune gastritis: a multicenter study.\r\nSEER-SCOPE AI demonstrated expert-level performance in identifying AIG, and enhanced the diagnostic ability of endoscopists.

HRCM shows that IBS-C patients have reduced PPW activity.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nECM1 attenuates hepatic fibrosis by interfering with mediators of latent TGF-β1 activation.\r\n Our findings underscore the hepatoprotective effect of ECM1, which interferes with mediators of LTGF-β1 activation, suggesting ECM1 or its representative peptide as potential antifibrotic therapies in CLD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIQGAP3 signalling mediates intratumoral functional heterogeneity to enhance malignant growth.\r\n IQGAP3 knockdown suppressed the RAS-TGFβ signalling crosstalk, leading to a significant reduction of the tumour microenvironment. In particular, IQGAP3 maintains functional heterogeneity of cancer cells to enhance malignant growth. IQGAP3 is thus a highly relevant therapy target in GC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe serum concentration of the third component of complement beta-1C-beta-1A in liver disease.\r\nHowever, 10 patients (six with active chronic hepatitis, four with cryptogenic cirrhosis) had hypocomplementaemia. The reason for the depression is not clear but could reflect either decreased synthesis or increased consumption, or a combination of the two.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nHepatology\r\n    Disparities in screening and risk stratification for hispanic adults with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.\r\nLower NIT cut-points may be needed to optimize surveillance for significant fibrosis due to MASLD in Hispanic populations commensurate with their higher burden and severity of disease.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe de-sulfinylation enzyme sulfiredoxin-1 attenuates hepatic stellate cell activation and liver fibrosis by modulating the PTPN12-NLRP3 axis.\r\nOur findings have uncovered an important role of SRXN1 and protein S-sulfinylation in HSC activation and liver fibrosis. The SRXN1-PTPN12-NLRP3 axis represents potential therapeutic targets for liver fibrosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    A metabolome-derived score predicts metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis and mortality from liver disease.\r\n The metabolome-derived MASH prediction score accurately predicts risk of MASH and MASLD-related mortality in both Chinese and European individuals. Impact and implications Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is associated with more than a 10-fold increase in liver-related death. However, biomarkers predicting not only MASH, but also death due to liver disease, are missing. We established a MASH prediction score based on 44 clinical parameters and 250 plasma metabolites using a machine learning strategy. This metabolome-derived MASH prediction score could accurately identify patients with MASH among both Chinese and Finnish individuals, and it was superior to the FIB-4 index and the NAFLD Fibrosis Score in predicting MASLD-related death in the general population. Thus, the new MASH prediction score is a useful tool for identifying individuals with a markedly increased risk of serious liver-related outcomes among at-risk and general populations.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nConcordance of ctDNA and tissue genomic profiling in advanced biliary tract cancer.\r\nAmong patients with advanced BTC, ctDNA-based genotyping showed acceptable concordance with tissue genomic profiling. Liquid biopsy using ctDNA could be a valuable complement to tissue-based genomic analysis in BTC. Impact and implications Our study is the first large-scale investigation of the clinical utility of liquid biopsy, focusing on ctDNA, as an alternative to conventional tumor tissue analysis, among Asian patients with advanced BTC. The results demonstrated acceptable concordance between analysis of ctDNA versus tissue for identifying therapeutic targets and potentially actionable genetic alterations. This indicates that ctDNA analysis can provide critical insights regarding advanced BTC treatment, particularly in cases where it is challenging to obtain or analyze tumor tissue.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHyperfunctional T cell responses unchecked by regulatory T cells are unable to resolve hepaciviral infection without humoral contribution.\r\nTregs control the outcome of RHV infection via direct modulation of CD4 + T cells and IgG production. Hyperactivated T cell responses are incapable of compensating for experimentally induced lack of antibodies, further reinforcing the notion of cooperative interplay between adaptive immune arms in facilitating hepaciviral clearance. Impact and implications We demonstrate herein how timing of Treg depletion determines the fate of effector T cells, humoral responses, and the kinetics of viral clearance. Our observations provide direct evidence that functional T cell responses are incapable of compensating for suboptimal humoral responses in facilitating viral resolution. Our results imply that future HCV vaccine regimens should not solely rely on eliciting focused responses of a single effector arm, but rather incorporate immunogens capable of inducing durable features of both humoral and cellular memory.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOral-gut microbiome interactions in advanced cirrhosis: characterisation of pathogenic enterotypes and salivatypes, virulence factors and antimicrobial.\r\n The degree of oral-gut microbial community overlap, frequency of VFs and ARGs al increment significantly with cirrhosis severity, with progressive dominance of pathobionts and loss of commensals. Despite similar antimicrobial exposure, patients with DC and ACLF have reduced microbial richness compared to NLS, supporting the additive pathobiological effect of cirrhosis. Impact and implications This research underscores the crucial role of microbiome alterations in the progression of cirrhosis in an era of escalating multidrug resistant infections, highlighting the association and potential impact of increased oral-gut microbial overlap, virulence factors, and antimicrobial resistance genes on clinical outcomes. These findings are particularly significant for patients with decompensated cirrhosis and acute-on-chronic liver failure, as they reveal the intricate relationship between microbiome alterations and cirrhosis complications. This is relevant in the context of multidrug-resistant organisms and reduced oral-gut microbial diversity that exacerbate cirrhosis severity, drive hepatic decompensation and complicate treatment. For practical applications, these insights could guide for cirrhosis patients the development of targeted microbiome-based therapeutics and personalised antimicrobial regimens to mitigate infectious complications to improve their clinical outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Editorial: The Impact of Socioeconomic and Ethnic Factors on Chronic Liver Disease.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) in Ulcerative Colitis: Holding Out for a Superdonor?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFunctional cure in a long-term follow-up of Children with chronic hepatitis B.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut Goo: Physiology, Diet, and Therapy of Intestinal Mucus and Biofilms in Gastrointestinal Health and Disease.\r\nA final goal is to review how certain dietary factors, especially low-fiber diets and emulsifiers common in Western diets, can harm the mucus layer.

The validation with NG-497 opens a new therapeutic perspective for MASLD. Impact and implications The global prevalence of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a crucial public health concern. Since adherence to behavioural interventions is limited, pharmacological strategies are necessary, as highlighted by the recent FDA approval of resmetirom. However, since our current mechanistic understanding and pathophysiology-oriented therapeutic options for MASLD are still limited, novel mechanistic insights are urgently needed. Our present work uncovers that pharmacological inhibition of ATGL, the key enzyme in lipid hydrolysis using Atglistatin (ATGLi), improves metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), fibrosis, and associated key features of metabolic dysfunction in a mouse model of MASH and MCD-induced liver fibrosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that attenuation of PPARα signalling in the liver and gut favours hydrophilic bile acid composition, ultimately interfering with dietary lipid absorption. One of the drawbacks of ATGLi is its lack of efficacy against human ATGL, thus limiting its clinical applicability. Against this backdrop, we could show that ATGL inhibition using the human inhibitor NG-497 in human primary ileum-derived organoids, Caco2 cells, and HepG2 cells translated into therapeutic mechanisms similar to ATGLi. Collectively, these findings open a new avenue for MASLD treatment development by inhibiting human ATGL activity.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPNPLA3 rs738409, environmental factors and liver-related mortality in the U.S. Population.\r\nPNPLA3 is associated with LRD and this relationship is significantly modified by anthropometric and environmental factors.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPlasma exchange does not improve overall survival in patients with acute liver failure in a real world cohort.\r\n PEX is now frequently used in the management of ALF patients in the UK.
