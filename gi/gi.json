For accurate monitoring of patients' colonoscopy experience, the use of PREMs should be considered.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOutcomes of Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection for High-Risk Colorectal Colitis-Associated Neoplasia in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\nESD of HR-CANs shows favorable outcomes on the medium and long-term course in IBD patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nStandard enhancement settings used on endoscopy systems significantly impair performance of artificial intelligence systems in endoscopy. \r\n This retrospective study indicates that performance of current endoscopic AI systems can substantially vary depending on the post-processing enhancement settings of the endoscopy unit. Specific data augmentation can mitigate this performance loss.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSurveillance of primary sclerosing cholangitis - a comparison of scheduled or on-demand ERCP with annual MRI surveillance: a multicenter study. \r\nNo differences were seen in liver-related deaths between the surveillance strategies. In this study comparing scheduled ERCP, annual MRI/MRCP surveillance, and on-demand ERCP, the strategy based on scheduled ERCP using individual risk stratification is associated with better overall prognosis and outcome.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Non-contrast magnetic resonance imaging versus ultrasonography for hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance: A randomized, single-center trial.\r\nNon-contrast MRI is a better alternative to US for the surveillance of cirrhotic patients offering earlier stage at initial diagnosis and lower false-positive referral rate. ClincalTrials.gov, NCT02514434.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    A Comparison of Endoscopic and Surgical Gastrojejunostomy in Patients with Malignant Gastric Outlet Obstruction: A National Cohort Analysis (2016-2020). \r\nCompared to surgical GJ, endoscopic GJ is associated with lower rates of peri-procedural adverse events, hospitalization charges, and length of stay. For these reasons, endoscopic GJ should be strongly considered in managing malignant gastric outlet obstruction.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterologists' Goals for Ergonomic Colonoscopes: Results of a National Survey. \r\nThe colonoscope changes respondents prioritized were those pertaining to customizability for hand size and more easily manipulated control surfaces. Professional societies and industry should work together to design scopes more aligned with best ergonomic principles.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLong-term outcomes after endoscopic eradication therapy for dysplastic and T1a adenocarcinoma related Barrett's esophagus: higher rate of late dysplastic recurrence with radio-frequency ablation monotherapy. \r\nThe risk of IM, dysplasia and late recurrence is higher when RFA was the sole modality used to achieve CRIM, raising the possibility that RFA provides a less durable response. These findings may impact treatment and surveillance decisions.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOutcomes of Anesthesia-Supported versus Endoscopist-Driven Sedation Modalities: A retrospective cohort study. \r\nThese were substantially lower than the rates for other sedation groups, and odds ratios were significantly lower than 1.00 (p<0.05) in 30 out of 36 comparisons across procedural, sedative, and outcome categories. Sedation achieved with Midazolam/Fentanyl correlated with a lower rate of adverse events but significantly longer PACU LOS compared to Propofol, Propofol + Adjuvants, or General Anesthesia.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPredicting the need for step-up after EUS-guided drainage of peripancreatic fluid collections, including Quadrant Necrosis Infection score validation: a prospective cohort study.\r\nThe high-risk QNI group was associated with a significantly longer hospital stay (12 days vs 4 days, p=0.004). EUS tended to upscale the necrotic content compared to preprocedural Radiology (κ=0.31) CONCLUSIONS: The extent of necrosis and the QNI classification strongly correlated with the need for step-up and allocation to LAMS vs DPPS drainage, proposing a central role in treatment personalization.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe effect of the timing of endoscopic detorsion on clinical outcomes in patients with sigmoid volvulus. \r\nThere does not appear to be a clear correlation between a longer delay until endoscopic detorsion and worse patient outcomes, with only the length of hospitalization affected. This suggests that endoscopic detorsion need not always be performed urgently.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    In vitro microbiota model recapitulates and predicts individualised sensitivity to dietary emulsifier. \r\nTransplant of human microbiotas that the MBRA model deemed CMC-sensitive, but not those deemed insensitive, into IL-10-/- germfree mice resulted in overt colitis following CMC feeding. These results suggest that an individual's sensitivity to emulsifier is a consequence of, and can thus be predicted by, examining their baseline microbiota, paving the way to microbiota-based personalised nutrition.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFasting-mimicking diet-enriched Bifidobacterium pseudolongum suppresses colorectal cancer by inducing memory CD8+ T cells. \r\nB. pseudolongum administration is a potential CRC therapeutic strategy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGlucocorticoid receptor suppresses GATA6-mediated RNA polymerase II pause release to modulate classical subtype identity in pancreatic cancer. \r\nConversely, in basal PDAC ΔNp63 promotes Pol II recruitment and stabilises enhancer-promoter interactions. This study provides new insights into the transcriptional control and role of GR agonists in controlling PDAC molecular subtype identity.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLow-coverage whole genome sequencing of low-grade dysplasia strongly predicts advanced neoplasia risk in ulcerative colitis. \r\nWithin-LGD lesion genetic heterogeneity did not confound risk prediction. Measurement of CNAs in LGD is an accurate predictor of AN risk in inflammatory bowel disease and is likely to support clinical management.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPredictors of response to low-dose amitriptyline for irritable bowel syndrome and efficacy and tolerability according to subtype: post hoc analyses from the ATLANTIS trial.\r\n These exploratory analyses demonstrate there are unlikely to be deleterious effects of amitriptyline in any particular IBS subtype and could help identify patients in whom amitriptyline may be more effective.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRisk factors for pancreatic cancer in individuals with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and no high-risk stigmata during up to 5 years of surveillance: a prospective longitudinal cohort study. \r\nIPMN size and its growth rate predict future pancreatic carcinoma risk only during first 5 years of follow-up. MPD diameter at 5 years may identify patients who still harbour a high risk for pancreatic carcinoma.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    Acute encephalopathy without hyperammonemia has a different presentation than overt hepatic encephalopathy and displays similarly severe prognosis. \r\nNonHep E accounts for one third of admissions for acute encephalopathy, and displays as severe prognosis as OHE. OHE is independently associated with lower transplant-free survival at one year.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClinical outcomes and care for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: A national cohort study. \r\nThe SBP bundle was associated with lower incidence of Stage 3 versus Stage 0-2 AKI (OR 0.66, 95%CI 0.51-0.86). Prospective implementation of evidence-based SBP bundles may improve care outcomes and mortality in SBP.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDiscovery of a MET-driven monogenic cause of steatotic liver disease. \r\nEight of 45 (17.7%) individuals had predicted deleterious variants in the MET kinase domain confirmed to be functionally like the familial case variant. We report the first germline non-malignant rare MET-driven disease, a monogenic form of SLD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIdentification of glycogen synthase kinase 3alpha/beta as a host factor required for hepatitis B virus transcription using high-throughput screening.\r\nOur recombinant HBV-based screening system enables the discovery of new targets. Using our approach, we identified GSK3 inhibitors as potential anti-HBV agents.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPSC and colitis: A complex relationship.\r\nWith this review, we aim to summarize the current knowledge on the gut-liver axis in PSC-IBD, provide new perspectives on risk stratification and treatment and identify gaps in our current knowledge. Our understanding of this complex relationship will therefore help to design clinical trials and shape the future therapy of PSC-IBD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPhosphoproteomics delineates hepatocellular carcinoma subtypes and pinpoints therapeutic targets. \r\nThe corresponding drug, bosutinib, demonstrated efficacy in inhibiting the growth of subtype C tumors in liver cancer cell lines and HCC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models representative of the phosphoproteomic HCC subtypes. Our study provides a comprehensive exploration of the phosphoproteomic landscape of HCC, establishing new subtypes that match clinical features and identifying potential therapeutic targets for the most malignant C subtype.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPrevalence and predictors of cirrhosis and portal hypertension in the united states. \r\nS. residents with cirrhosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nShort-term starvation boosts anti-PD-L1 therapy by reshaping tumor-associated macrophages in hepatocellular carcinoma. \r\nModulating FBP1/Akt/Rab27a axis potentiates the anti-PD-L1 response using two liposomal delivery systems and macrophage adoptive transfer. This study describes the immunomodulatory effects of STS and provides a rationale for its application as an adjuvant in HCC immunotherapy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTIGIT-expression on natural killer cell subsets is an early indicator of alleviating liver inflammation following bulevirtide treatment in chronic hepatitis D.\r\nWe here suggest that lacking the expression of the immune checkpoint inhibitor TIGIT on NK cell subtypes may be a hallmark of liver inflammation in HDV infection. BLV-therapy is associated with a reappearance of TIGIT on these cells, which may be one mechanism of why liver enzymes rapidly improve during therapy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Contrast-enhanced ultrasound-based AI model for multi-classification of focal liver lesions.\r\nCEUS-based Model -DCB provides accurate multi-classification of FLLs. It holds promise to benefit a wide range of population, especially for patients in remote suburban areas who have difficulty accessing MRI. Impact and implications Ultrasound is the most common image examination for screening focal liver lesions (FLLs), but it lacks accuracy for multi-classification, which is the prerequisite for reasonable management. Contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) offers better diagnostic performance, but highly relies on work experience of radiologists. We develop a CEUS-based model (Model -DCB ) can assist junior CEUS radiologists to achieve comparable diagnostic ability to senior CEUS radiologists and senior MRI radiologists. The combination of ultrasound device, CEUS examination and Model -DCB enables even patients in remote areas to obtain excellent diagnostic performance through examination by junior radiologists. Clinical trial NCT04682886.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGRINA alleviates hepatic ischemia‒reperfusion injury-induced apoptosis and ER-phagy by enhancing HRD1-mediated ATF6 ubiquitination.\r\nOur study highlights the critical role of the GRINA-HRD1-ATF6 complex in regulating ER stress and autophagy during HIRI. These findings provide new insights into therapeutic strategies to alleviate HIRI. Impact and implications HIRI represents a multifaceted pathophysiological challenge commonly encountered during liver surgeries, yet its underlying molecular mechanisms remain inadequately understood. In this study, we revealed a significant negative correlation between GRINA levels and the severity of liver damage in patients with HIRI. Our findings demonstrate that GRINA alleviates endoplasmic reticulum stress by enhancing HRD1-mediated ubiquitination of ATF6, thereby maintaining calcium homeostasis and inhibiting ER-phagy. This study provides novel insights into the role of GRINA in protecting liver cells under HIRI, offering fresh perspectives for clinical prevention and management strategies for HIRI.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatocellular CMPK2 promotes the development of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis.\r\nThese findings establish CMPK2 as a critical mediator in the progression from metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver (MASL) to MASH and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic diseases. Impact and implications CMPK2 exhibits upregulated in the MASH stage but not in the early stages of MASLD. Our study demonstrated that diet-induced MASH phenotypes, including liver injury, inflammation, and fibrosis were alleviated in hepatocyte-specific Cmpk2-knockout mice. These findings suggest that CMPK2 serve as a critical link in the progression of steatotic liver to steatohepatitis, offering novel mechanistic insights MASH development. Furthermore, this discovery identified CMPK2 as a promising target for the development of therapeutic drugs for MASH.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPrognostic performance of the two-step clinical care pathway in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.\r\nNon-invasive 2-step approach by FIB-4 followed by LSM is effective in classifying patients at different risks of LREs. Impact and implications Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is emerging as one of the leading causes of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide, but only a minority of patients will develop these complications. Therefore, it is necessary to use non-invasive tests instead of liver biopsy for risk stratification. Additionally, as most patients with MASLD are seen in primary care instead of specialist settings, cost and availability of the tests should be taken into consideration. In this multicentre study, the use of Fibrosis-4 index followed by liver stiffness measurement by vibration-controlled transient elastography effectively identified patients who would later develop liver-related events. The results support current recommendations by various regional guidelines on a clinical care pathway based on non-invasive tests to diagnose advanced liver fibrosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Editorial: Alpha2-Delta Ligands in Irritable Bowel Syndrome. \r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Development and Validation of a Multimodal Machine Learning Model for Diagnosing and Assessing Risk of Crohn's Disease in Patients With Perianal Fistula.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Steatotic Liver Diseases Emerge as Rapidly Growing Drivers of Primary Liver Cancer in the United States.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Blue Notes.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nContinuing the Commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Within AGA Journals.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    Clinical Applications of Device-Assisted Enteroscopy: A Comprehensive Review. \r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease in children.\r\nMASLD is a complex disease affecting one in ten children and is associated with increased early mortality risk.

DCE was superior for dysplasia detection in colonic IBD. DCE was superior to HD-WLE in colonic IBD. DCE was the best technique in UC. Further studies to compare HD-WLE-SR and NBI with DCE are warranted to ascertain performance equivalency and define the optimal surveillance technique.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Eradication Therapy to Prevent Gastric Cancer in H. pylori-positive individuals: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials and Observational Studies.\r\nThis meta-analysis provides further evidence that administering eradication therapy prevents gastric cancer in H. pylori-positive individuals, with consistency in results among studies of different design.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Disparities in Alcohol-Associated Liver Disease Hospital Encounters Amongst a Texas-Based Cohort of Patients.\r\n The highest increases of alcohol-associated encounters were observed amongst young Hispanic and NHB women, highlighting variation in trends by age, sex, race and ethnicity. These disparities merit further investigation to elucidate underlying mechanisms and develop tailored interventions to improve ALD burden and outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHead-to-Head Comparison Between Phosphatidylethanol Versus Indirect Alcohol Biomarkers for Diagnosis of MetALD Versus MASLD: A Prospective Study.\r\nPEth outperforms previously used non-invasive tests in differentiating MetALD from MASLD and has the potential to change clinical practice by enhancing the subclassification of SLD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nObesity Is Associated With Worsened Outcomes in Patients With Ulcerative Colitis on Advanced Therapies: A Propensity Matched Cohort Study From the U.S.\r\nObesity is associated with lower efficacy of several advanced therapies in patients with UC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRetrospective Cohort Study: Scope for Improvement-Barriers to Post-Polypectomy Surveillance in the Integrated Technologies for Improved Polyp Surveillance Cohort.\r\n Patients from more socioeconomically deprived areas are less likely to have appropriate post-polypectomy surveillance, and are more likely to have metachronous polyps and colorectal cancer even when they do. Conclusion Surveillance strategies must take into account factors including socioeconomic deprivation and comorbidity exist to improve surveillance uptake in this group through the design of targeted interventions which move away from the current \"one size fits all\" approach.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAm J Gastroenterol\r\n    Clinical Outcomes in A Multi-center Cohort Involving 919 Patients with Hypertriglyceridemia-associated Acute Pancreatitis.\r\nUsing a multi-center cross-regional cohort, we demonstrated that HTG-AP had a higher risk of developing severe AP and organ failure. A risk prediction model for predicting severe AP was developed and effectively stratified patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDiscovery of Methylated DNA Biomarkers for Potential Non-Endoscopic Detection of Barrett's Esophagus and Esophageal Adenocarcinoma.\r\nThis discriminatory biomarker panel algorithm exemplifies a practical nonendoscopic strategy to diagnose BE, HGD, and EAC using a minimally-invasive sponge-capsule device coupled with DNA methylation markers.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nENHANCEMENT OF CIRRHOSIS MORTALITY PREDICTION BY INCLUDING HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY TO MELD3.0 IN A NATIONAL VETERAN COHORT.\r\nThe addition of HE to MELD3.0 and MELD-Na significantly improved their mortality prediction with interactions at 90-days and 1-year on multivariable regression. A documented inpatient HE episode is additive to the mortality prediction of MELD3.0 by 4-5 extra points and could enhance future MELD iterations.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHigh Cirrhosis Surgical Volume Centers have Reduced Postoperative Mortality in Patients with Cirrhosis Undergoing Major Surgery.\r\nIn this retrospective cohort study of 14,500 major surgeries in patients with cirrhosis, we found in adjusted analysis that high-volume centers (>16 surgeries in past year) had a 36% reduced hazard of post-operative mortality through 90 days versus low-volume centers (<9 surgeries in past year;  hazard ratio 0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.43-0.94, p=0.02). These findings demonstrate the importance of triaging patients with cirrhosis to high-volume centers for major surgery when feasible.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHigher Relapse Rate in HBeAg-negative Patients After Cessation of Tenofovir Alafenamide Compared to Entecavir or Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate.\r\nThere is an earlier and higher HBV relapse rate in patients who discontinue TAF therapy than in comparable patients discontinuing entecavir or TDF therapy. Close monitoring is necessary after TAF withdrawal, particularly in the first 3 months.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMedications for Alcohol Use Disorder Are Increasingly Being Prescribed in American Patients with Advanced Liver Disease.\r\nThe rate of AUD medication discontinuation for adverse events was similar in both groups (14% vs 12%). Naltrexone, acamprosate, and disulfiram are increasingly being prescribed in American patients with mild and severe ALD with similar tolerability and efficacy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPeriodontitis and the incidence of inflammatory bowel diseases: A nationwide population-based cohort study.\r\nPeriodontitis may augment the risk of incidence for CD and UC. This association underscores the potential significance of periodontal health in the context of IBD, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive oral hygiene practices and potential preventive strategies to reduce the risk of CD and UC incidence.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPrevalence and clinical impact of the London classification: a prospective, international, multicenter study from the Lower Gastrointestinal International Consortium (LoGIC).\r\n This prospective multicenter study provides information on the prevalence and clinical impact of the London classification, and will guide refinement of the current London classification.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Gender-Equity Model for Liver Allocation using Artificial Intelligence (GEMA-AI) for waiting list liver transplant prioritization. \r\nThe use of explainable machine learning models may be preferred over conventional regression-based models for waiting list prioritization in LT. GEMA-AI made more accurate predictions of waiting list outcomes, particularly for the sickest patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopy\r\n    Outcomes of Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection for High-Risk Colorectal Colitis-Associated Neoplasia in Inflammatory Bowel Disease. \r\nPost-resection surgery was required in 11.5% (95%CI 0.114;  0.058-0.195) of cases. ESD of HR-CANs shows favorable outcomes on the medium and long-term course in IBD patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Physiological Data Collected from Wearable Devices Identify and Predict Inflammatory Bowel Disease Flares.\r\nLongitudinally collected physiological metrics from wearable devices can identify and change prior to IBD flares, suggesting their feasibility to monitor and predict IBD activity.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    Computer-Assisted Classification of the Squamocolumnar Junction.\r\n Our computer-generated model was capable of auto-segmentation and classification of the z-line.

EUS tended to upscale the necrotic content compared to preprocedural Radiology (κ=0.31) CONCLUSIONS: The extent of necrosis and the QNI classification strongly correlated with the need for step-up and allocation to LAMS vs DPPS drainage, proposing a central role in treatment personalization.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Clinical Utility of Incorporating Next-Generation Sequencing Results in the Management Algorithm of Pancreatic Cysts.\r\n NGS informed surgical decision-making, cyst type differentiation, and evaluation of pancreatic duct dilation, leading to changes in management. Indeed, NGS emerges as a useful tool in select patients with pancreatic lesions by improving diagnostic precision and guiding patient care paths.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nYield of Esophageal Biopsy Patterns for the Diagnosis of Eosinophilic Esophagitis.\r\nIsolated segmental eosinophilia is common in EoE, including up to 10% non-distal disease. Discordant mid and proximal biopsy findings are prevalent, with no isolated proximal eosinophilia. Standard protocol should include routine biopsies of both distal and middle esophagus to maximize diagnostic yield.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    Surveillance in inflammatory bowel disease: white light endoscopy with segmental re-inspection versus dye-based chromoendoscopy - a multi-arm randomised controlled trial (HELIOS).\r\nHD white-light endoscopy with segmental re-inspection was non-inferior to HD chromoendoscopy for colorectal neoplasia detection in IBD patients. It can therefore be assumed that the benefit of HD chromoendoscopy may be explained by the longer withdrawal time and not necessarily the enhanced contrast. However, re-inspection per se did not lead to a significantly higher colorectal neoplasia rate than single-pass HD white-light endoscopy alone.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTargeting MXD1 sensitises pancreatic cancer to trametinib.\r\nOur study has discovered an important mechanism for trametinib resistance and identified MXD1 as a druggable target in treatment of trametinib-resistant PDAC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nUnlocking novel T cell-based immunotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma through neoantigen-driven T cell receptor isolation.\r\n These findings offer valuable insights into the functional profiles of neoantigen-reactive T cells within and surrounding the HCC microenvironment. T cells isolated from liver flushes and tumour-draining lymph nodes may serve as a promising source of reactive T cells and TCRs for further use in immunotherapy for HCC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    Identification of glycogen synthase kinase 3alpha/beta as a host factor required for hepatitis B virus transcription using high-throughput screening.\r\nOur recombinant HBV-based screening system enables the discovery of new targets. Using our approach, we identified GSK3 inhibitors as potential anti-HBV agents.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLong-term outcome and risk stratification in compensated advanced chronic liver disease after HCV-cure.\r\nBaveno VII criteria to exclude (FU-liver stiffness measurement 3 y). One-time post-treatment risk stratification based on noninvasive criteria provides important prognostic information that is maintained during long-term follow-up, as the hazards remain proportional over time.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPSC and colitis: A complex relationship.\r\nWith this review, we aim to summarize the current knowledge on the gut-liver axis in PSC-IBD, provide new perspectives on risk stratification and treatment and identify gaps in our current knowledge. Our understanding of this complex relationship will therefore help to design clinical trials and shape the future therapy of PSC-IBD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTIGIT-expression on natural killer cell subsets is an early indicator of alleviating liver inflammation following bulevirtide treatment in chronic hepatitis D.\r\nWe here suggest that lacking the expression of the immune checkpoint inhibitor TIGIT on NK cell subtypes may be a hallmark of liver inflammation in HDV infection. BLV-therapy is associated with a reappearance of TIGIT on these cells, which may be one mechanism of why liver enzymes rapidly improve during therapy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Circulating monocytes upregulate CD52 and sustain innate immune function in cirrhosis unless acute decompensation emerges.\r\n CD52 may represent a biologically relevant target for future immunotherapy. Stabilising CD52 may enhance monocyte functions and infection control in the context of cirrhosis, guided by sCD52/PLC as biomarkers indicating immuneparesis. Impact and implications Monocyte dysfunction substantially contributes to infection susceptibility which determines the prognosis of cirrhosis patients, and represents a critical condition with unmet therapeutic needs. Its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood, although among hepatologists a better understanding of the monocyte pathophysiology in relation to cirrhosis stages, and a therapeutic reconstitution of monocyte function are believed to enhance defence against infection and thus reduce morbidity and mortality of patients with cirrhosis in the future. By systematically delineating the heterogeneity and function of circulating monocytes ex vivo, we identified that the absence of CD52 expression on monocytes represented a distinct biomarker of monocyte dysfunction in patients with cirrhosis, discriminating patients at substantial risk for infectious complications. Otherwise, given the beneficial antimicrobial functions of CD52-expressing monocytes, CD52-stablisation may also represent such a target for immunotherapy worth exploring, at it has been desired in clinical practise.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nContrast-enhanced ultrasound-based AI model for multi-classification of focal liver lesions. \r\nThe combination of ultrasound device, CEUS examination and Model-DCB enables even patients in remote areas to obtain excellent diagnostic performance through examination by junior radiologists. NCT04682886.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGenomic and transcriptomic signatures of sequential carcinogenesis from papillary neoplasm to biliary tract cancer.\r\nWith the largest IPN/ICPN cohort reported to date, our study provides a genome- and spatial transcriptome-level portrait of sequential carcinogenesis and differences in the anatomical location of biliary papillary neoplasms. Impact and implications Biliary tract cancer is a fatal malignancy. However, its genome-level sequential carcinogenesis from intraepithelial neoplasia to carcinoma has not yet been evaluated in a sufficiently large cohort. Papillary lesions of the bile duct and gallbladder are collectively termed intraductal papillary neoplasms (IPN) of the bile duct and intracholecystic papillary neoplasms (ICPN), respectively. They are primarily diagnosed based on histopathological studies. This study provides a comprehensive mutational and spatial transcriptomic landscape of papillary neoplasms of the bile duct and gallbladder. The results of this study offer insights into the mechanism of sequential carcinogenesis in papillary biliary tract tumors, pathology-genomics correlation, and potential therapeutic targets.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nModeling the Health and Economic Impact of Pharmacologic Therapies for MASLD in the United States.\r\nIncreasing diagnosis and treatment for the MASLD population with moderate-to-advanced fibrosis will prevent advanced liver disease and death and will result in reducing the associated direct healthcare costs. Increasing awareness, screening and diagnosis along with introducing pharmacologic therapies that halt fibrosis progression are necessary to realize health and economic benefits for the MASLD population. Impact and implications MASLD, the most rapidly increasing and prevalent liver disease, leads to chronic liver disease which generates substantial health care costs. As disease burden and costs mount, pharmacologic therapy which halts MASLD fibrosis progression is coming to fruition. Modeling the impact on disease progression of a hypothetical pharmacologic therapy which halts MASLD fibrosis progression through multiple scenarios provides insights into the key drivers of the disease and costs associated with it to facilitate best policies and practices to mitigate the burden of MASLD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPan-PPAR agonist lanifibranor improves insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in patients with T2D and MASLD.\r\nLanifibranor significantly improves hepatic, muscle and adipose tissue insulin resistance. Lanifibranor treatment was safe and effective in reducing hepatic steatosis and cardiometabolic risk factors associated with metabolic dysfunction. Impact and implications No prior studies have evaluated the effect of lanifibranor on insulin sensitivity at the level of muscle, liver and adipose tissue and its relationship to changes in intrahepatic triglyceride (IHTG) content in insulin resistant subjects with MASLD and T2D. We observed a significant decrease in IHTG after 24 weeks of treatment (by ∼50%, p < 0.001 versus placebo) that was associated with a major improvement in hepatic and peripheral (Rd) insulin sensitivity, restoration of adipose tissue function with more than two-fold increase in plasma adiponectin concentration and improvement in cardiometabolic risk factors. This is the first in-depth study on how a pan-PPAR approach reverses steatosis and metabolic dysfunction in patients with T2D and MASLD. It has important clinical implications because it offers proof-of-concept that by targeting the key underlying metabolic defects in MASLD (i.e., insulin resistance, lipotoxicity and hyperglycemia) one can restore cardiometabolic health and offers a compelling rationale for treating with lanifibranor individuals with MASLD, either alone or in combination with weight loss and other treatment strategies.

Patients who screen positive for depression or anxiety should be referred to the appropriate specialist, be it their primary care physician or a mental health specialist.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeta-analysis\r\nmeta-analyses and systematic reviews\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Meta-Analysis of Placebo-Treated Patients: Dropout Rates From Treatment in MASH Randomised Controlled Trials.\r\n Placebo dropout in MASH RCTs is significant, mainly due to patient choice. Factors such as trial phase and treatment duration should be considered when calculating sample size in future clinical trials.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMeta-Analysis: Exclusive Enteral Nutrition in Adults With Ulcerative Colitis.\r\n EEN was well tolerated with low therapy discontinuation in adults with active ulcerative colitis. However, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of EEN as an adjunctive therapy to standard of care. Further, well-designed studies with reproducible methodology and endpoints are necessary to evaluate its effectiveness. Registry number for systematic review PROSPERO 2022 CRD42022319584.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopy\r\n    Endoscopic size measurement of colorectal polyps: a systematic review of techniques.\r\nWhile biopsy forceps, snare, and graduated devices can improve the accuracy of visual size estimation, their clinical implementation is limited by practical, time, and cost challenges. Computer-based techniques will likely offer improved accuracy of polyp sizing in the near future.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Neurogastroenterol Motil\r\n    Effect of Buspirone on Upper Gastrointestinal Disorders of Gut-Brain Interaction: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.\r\nWe found that buspirone did not improve functional dyspepsia symptoms more than placebo, though studies were small. Buspirone showed benefit for bloating severity, albeit based on few studies. Larger and longer trials of buspirone, targeting more defined groups such as patients with bloating, are warranted.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEfficacy of Amitriptyline in Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.\r\nAmitriptyline was found to be well-tolerated and effective in treating IBS compared to placebo. These findings support the use of amitriptyline for the management of IBS, particularly among patients with the IBS diarrhea subtype. Future research should focus on the dose-dependent effects of amitriptyline in IBS to better guide clinicians in personalized titration regimens.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Baseline Drug Clearance Predicts Outcomes in Children With Inflammatory Bowel Disease Treated With Vedolizumab: Results From the VedoKids Prospective Multicentre Study.\r\nDrug clearance was strongly influenced by serum albumin. Baseline clearance predicted deep biochemical remission at Week 30. Further investigation is needed to better understand optimal dosing strategies-especially for lower-weight children receiving vedolizumab.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nBlood Group B May Reduce Risk of Rebleeding in Patients With Upper Gastrointestinal Haemorrhage due to Peptic Ulcer Disease.\r\nBlood group B was associated with reduced risk in the composite outcome of rebleeding, need for surgery or embolisation and mortality (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.04-0.63, p = 0.009). Blood group B was protective against rebleeding compared to non-blood group B (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05-0.84, p = 0.028).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCOLOFIT: Development and Internal-External Validation of Models Using Age, Sex, Faecal Immunochemical and Blood Tests to Optimise Diagnosis of Colorectal Cancer in Symptomatic Patients. \r\nFor approximately 100,000 people per year with symptoms of suspected CRC, we predict it might save > 4500 colonoscopies with no evidence that more cancers would be missed if we used our model compared to using FIT f-Hb ≥ 10 μg/g. Including age, sex, MCV, platelets and f-Hb in a survival analysis model to predict the risk of CRC yields greater diagnostic utility than a simple binary cut off f-Hb ≥ 10 μg/g.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClinical Trial: Study to Investigate the Efficacy and Safety of the Alpha-2-Delta Ligand PD-217,014 in Patients With Irritable Bowel Syndrome.\r\n This first large, dose-ranging trial examining the efficacy of PD-217,014 showed no significant efficacy in participants with IBS or bowel habit sub-types, irrespective of their pain and anxiety levels.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCurrent Burden of Lean Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease Among US Adults, 2017-2023.\r\nSpecifically, the prevalence was 9.3% for lean MASLD, 1.3% for MetALD and 1.0% for ALD. Notably, within the MASLD group, significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis, and cirrhosis were observed in 5.6%, 2.4% and 2.0%, respectively.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEarly Dynamics of Portal Pressure Gradient After TIPS Insertion Predict Mortality.\r\n Lack of increased ΔPPG post-TIPS insertion identifies a high-risk patient group with worse survival. We propose incorporating this second PPG measurement and determining ΔPPG into clinical practice to identify these patients early and tailor post-TIPS patient care.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGlucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists and Liver Outcomes in Patients With MASLD and Type 2 Diabetes.\r\n GLP-1 RAs are associated with better long-term liver outcomes compared to SGLT2is in patients with MASLD and T2D.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflammatory Potential of the Diet and Risk of Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis.\r\nA high ISD score is associated with a higher risk of developing CD but not UC. These results should be taken into account in high-risk populations.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nUse of a Non-Endoscopic Capsule-Sponge Triage Test for Reflux Symptoms: Results From the NHS England Prospective Real-World Evaluation.\r\nCapsule sponge triage is feasible, safe and acceptable. It substantially reduces the endoscopy burden for routine reflux referrals with a favourable diagnostic yield for Barrett's oesophagus. Longer term follow-up will help to confidently assess the impact of the programme and place of capsule sponge in the diagnostic pathway.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAm J Gastroenterol\r\n    \"INSERT-COIN\": A PROSPECTIVE STUDY OF COIN INGESTION IN CHILDREN OF SOUTHERN ITALY.\r\nWhen coins are trapped in the middle/lower esophagus, we suggest withholding the procedure for at least 6-12 hours, especially for older children, as ⅔ pass spontaneously, not requiring endoscopic removal.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAdaptive Behaviors, Esophageal Anxiety and Hypervigilance Modify the Association Between Dysphagia Perception and Histological Disease Activity in Eosinophilic Esophagitis.\r\nHigher esophageal anxiety, hypervigilance and use of adaptive behaviors are associated with active EoE and represent clinical markers of HDA. Adaptive behaviours provide complementary clinical information that is not detected by symptoms alone. The assessment of anxiety, hypervigilance, and adaptive behaviors improves the correlation between clinical and HDA in EoE.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCardiovascular Risk from Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease, Cardiometabolic Risk Factor Count, and Their Longitudinal Changes: A Nationwide Cohort Study.\r\n MASLD status, cardiometabolic risk factor count, and their longitudinal changes were al associated with the risk of incident CVD. Accurate identification of these markers may facilitate personalized management of MASLD-related CVD risk.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClinical Outcomes in A Multi-center Cohort Involving 919 Patients with Hypertriglyceridemia-associated Acute Pancreatitis.\r\nUsing a multi-center cross-regional cohort, we demonstrated that HTG-AP had a higher risk of developing severe AP and organ failure. A risk prediction model for predicting severe AP was developed and effectively stratified patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nColorectal cancer screening based on predicted risk: a randomized controlled trial.\r\nIn a population not known to be at elevated CRC risk, brochures providing personalized CRC risk and screening recommendations improved risk-appropriate screening without impacting overall screening uptake. This approach could be helpful for aligning screening methods, risks, and benefits with cancer risk and resource allocation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHealth-Care Utilization of Children Born to Women with and Without Inflammatory Bowel Disease in the First Five Years of Life: A Population-Cohort Study.\r\n Children born to women with IBD may have increased healthcare utilization compared to those born to women without IBD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIdentifying and treating metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease among at-risk Veterans.\r\nFew at-risk Veterans carried a MASLD diagnosis or had undergone staging elastography. Because MASLD diagnosis was associated with linkage to hepatology care and weight loss therapy services, implementation of population screening and management services for MASLD is critically needed.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImpact of Prior Biologic Exposure on Ozanimod Efficacy and Safety in the Phase 3 True North Clinical Trial.\r\nOzanimod was effective and safe in biologic-exposed patients with UC, but these patients may require more time to respond to treatment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIncreased medication utilization precedes incidentally diagnosed inflammatory bowel disease: a multicenter, case-control study.\r\nAsymptomatic patients showed a higher use of cardiovascular, antiparasitic, musculoskeletal, respiratory, and sensory organ medications up to five years before diagnosis. This trend suggests that a systemic inflammatory process occurs years before clinical onset of IBD, suggesting the potential for earlier diagnosis and intervention.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInfliximab and adalimumab in the treatment of fistulizing Crohn's disease: a propensity score-matched analysis from the prospective Persistence Australian National IBD Cohort (PANIC4) study.\r\n The PANIC cohort with real-world data of non-hierarchical prescribing of biological agents supports the superiority of infliximab over adalimumab in bio-naïve FCD patients, but did not show a therapeutic difference in bio-exposed FCD. Thiopurine co-therapy was independently associated with improved biological agent persistence in FCD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLongitudinal associations between metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and subclinical cardiovascular measures in Chinese children.\r\n These findings support the clinical utility of MASLD in predicting the development of subclinical cardiovascular damages in childhood.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMulti-target Stool DNA Testing for Colorectal Cancer Screening in Clinical Practice.\r\nOnly 54.7% of patients completed their mt-sDNA test order. Older individuals were more likely to complete testing and test positive. Black patients were less likely to complete testing and, unexpectedly, less likely to test positive. Further exploration of mt-sDNA utilization including better understanding of the determinants of uptake, appropriateness, and evaluation of outcomes at colonoscopy is needed.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nObesity is Independently Associated with Increased Risk of Fecal Incontinence and Altered Rectal Sensitivity.\r\nClasses II+III obesity was an independent risk factor for FI. Among patients with FI, increasing BMI and class II+III obesity were associated with altered rectal sensitivity. Anorectal function testing should be considered to help guide management of FI among patients with obesity.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOral microbiome dysbiosis is associated with precancerous lesions and disorders of upper gastrointestinal tract: A population-based study.\r\n Dysbiosis of the saliva microbiota is linked to various UGI disorders. However, microbiota dysbiosis in subgingival and buccal mucosa sites are specifically associated with the pre-malignant conditions Barrett's esophagus and gastric atrophy. The oral microbiome, particularly in the subgingival location, might act as biomarkers for UGI cancers.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nProspective evaluation of opioid cessation in patients with suspected Opioid-induced esophageal dysfunction (OIED).\r\n Discontinuation of opioids is associated with clinical and esophageal motility improvement in up to half of the patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRisk of cancer and reoperation after ileorectal anastomosis and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis in familial adenomatous polyposis.\r\nOver the last three decades, few patients were diagnosed with cancer in the rectum or rectal cuff/pouch after (procto)colectomy in FAP. This might be due to an improved selection of the type of (procto)colectomy and close endoscopic surveillance including prophylactic polypectomies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRome IV functional defecation disorder: time for a change in symptom criteria for improved clinical relevance?\r\n Rome IV symptom criteria need revision to include more defecatory symptoms, include al subtypes of IBS, and be inclusive of those with either loose stools or more frequent stools such as those previously labelled with \"pseudodiarrhea\" or \"hyperdefecation\". Continuing to include physiology criteria in the Rome diagnosis of FDD appears valid.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSAFETY, PHARMACOKINETICS, AND CLINICAL EFFICACY OF ADS051, A NEUTROPHIL MODULATOR, IN ULCERATIVE COLITIS: RESULTS OF A RANDOMIZED PHASE 1B TRIAL.\r\nPhase 1b data in patients with UC indicate a favorable safety profile for ADS051 with encouraging signals of clinical activity, supporting the advancement to a Phase 2 trial.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nStudy of the cortico-anorectal neurophysiology in women with fecal incontinence.\r\n Women with FI show significant neuropathy in the cortico-spino-anorectal pathway linked to impaired anorectal function. These findings underscore the brain-gut axis's role in FI pathophysiology, advocating for advanced neurophysiological diagnostics and targeted interventions.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Effect of Low-dose Aspirin on Disease Activity in Pregnant Individuals with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\n Approximately one-third of patients with IBD cared for in a MFM practice were prescribed LDA during pregnancy. The use of aspirin among pregnant patients with IBD was not associated with an increased risk of disease activity.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopy\r\n    Comparison of Adenoma Detection Rate Between Three-dimensional and Standard Colonoscopy: A Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial.\r\n3D colonoscopy improved the detection of adenomas without significantly increasing the mucosa inspection time. (ClinicalTrials.gov  NCT05153746).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRandomized comparison of precut papillotomy and endosonography guided rendezvous procedure for difficult biliary access in Malignant distal biliary obstruction.\r\n Both PcP and EUS-RV have comparable success, AER, mortality, and LOS. EUS RV could be used as an alternative to PcP in patients with malignant distal biliary obstruction and DBC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSafety and Effectiveness of EUS-Guided Gallbladder Drainage in Patients with Cirrhosis: An International Multicenter Experience.\r\n Our international multicenter experience suggests EUS-GBD is safe and effective in patients with cirrhosis, with outcomes similar to patients without cirrhosis when performed by experienced echoendoscopists. Patients with cirrhosis and symptomatic gallbladder disease can be considered for EUS-GBD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Mechanistic implications of the Mediterranean diet in patients with newly diagnosed Crohn's disease- multi-omic results from a prospective cohort.\r\n Adherence to MED is associated with beneficial clinical outcomes and decreased inflammatory markers. These may be driven by lower levels of primary bile-acids and microbial dysbiosis and a beneficial microbial and metabolite composition. Randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate the role of MED in CD management.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRisk of colorectal cancer associated with frequency of colorectal polyp diagnosis in relatives.\r\nA higher frequency of colorectal polyp diagnosis in relatives is associated with a greater risk of CRC, especially early-onset CRC. This risk is independent of number of affected relatives or youngest age at polyp diagnosis. These findings underscore the need for more personalized CRC screening strategies that are tailored to individuals with a family history of polyp.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    British Society of Gastroenterology National Evaluation of Colonoscopy Quality: Findings from the National Endoscopy Database.\r\nUK colonoscopy quality has improved, yet almost 40% of endoscopists still fell short of minimum standards. Variation in quality was strongly associated with endoscopist procedure volumes;  mandating minimum annual procedures and emphasising longer withdrawal times could improve overall quality.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopic Ultrasound-Guided Drainage of Intra-Abdominal Abscess Using 15-mm vs. 10-mm Lumen-Apposing Metal Stents: An International Case-Matched Study.\r\n Both sizes showed comparable clinical success and safety profiles, with a significant trend of the need for fewer endoscopic procedures with the 15-mm LAMS.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nQuadrant, necrosis, and infection criteria for the risk stratification of walled-off necrosis: external validation using multi-institutional data.\r\nThe QNI criteria effectively stratified time to clinical success and the risk of adverse outcomes for patients receiving EUS-PFD of WON. Further investigations could elucidate appropriate management strategies based on QNI-based risk stratification.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Clinical Utility of Incorporating Next-Generation Sequencing Results in the Management Algorithm of Pancreatic Cysts.\r\n NGS informed surgical decision-making, cyst type differentiation, and evaluation of pancreatic duct dilation, leading to changes in management. Indeed, NGS emerges as a useful tool in select patients with pancreatic lesions by improving diagnostic precision and guiding patient care paths.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    Induction of macrophage efferocytosis in pancreatic cancer via PI3Kγ inhibition and radiotherapy promotes tumour control.\r\nOur data supports a new immunotherapeutic approach and a translational rationale to improve survival in PDAC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nWithdrawal of antitumour necrosis factor in inflammatory bowel disease patients in remission: a randomised placebo-controlled clinical trial of GETECCU.\r\n Anti-TNF withdrawal in selected patients with IBD in clinical, endoscopic and radiological remission has no impact on sustained clinical remission at 1 year although objective markers of activity were higher in patients who withdrew treatment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    Adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma following curative resection: A randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial.\r\nPostoperative adjuvant TACE was not associated with prolonged RFS or OS in AJCC TNM stage I or II HCC patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCD44 in myEloid cells is a major driver of liver inflammation and injury in alcohol-related liver disease.\r\nHuman and experimental evidence supports CD44 as a marker of hepatic inflammation in ALD. In addition, CD44 modulates neutrophil mobilization and functions and its targeting partially prevents liver inflammation and injury in the context of acute-on-chronic alcohol drinking.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nComparing the cost of cirrhosis to other common chronic diseases: A longitudinal study in a large national insurance database.\r\n The cost of care for cirrhosis is high, significantly higher than HF and COPD. Interventions directed at optimizing care to prevent progression to cirrhosis and decompensation are likely to alleviate this public health burden.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDownstaging of hepatocellular carcinoma before liver transplantation: Results from a national multi-center prospective cohort study.\r\nDespite higher HCC recurrence and lower ITT survival in AC, post-LT survival was comparable between UNOS-DS and AC. Y-90 attained higher DS success than TACE in AC. LT after downstaging is feasible in AC, though defining an upper limit in tumor burden may be necessary.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEnd-procedural adherence to recommended hemodynamic targets does not improve the outcome of elective tips in cirrhotic patients.\r\nAHR measured at the end of an elective TIPS may not be essential to define the eventual outcome, while a marked drop in PCPG could negatively affect the prognosis of patients with RA.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIdentification of optimal portal pressure decrease to control ascites while minimizing hepatic encephalopathy after TIPS: A multicenter study.\r\nA targeted PPG reduction of 60-80% showed significantly reduced HDA without increased oHE risk. Therefore, PPG reduction within this range could be a valid reduction target.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIn vivo selection of hepatocytes.\r\nFinally, recent work has shown that somatic mutations produce clonal expansion of injury-resistant hepatocytes in most chronic liver diseases. In this review, we will address the role of hepatocyte selection in disease pathophysiology and therapeutic strategies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLong-term outcome and risk stratification in compensated advanced chronic liver disease after HCV-cure.\r\nBaveno VII criteria to exclude (FU-liver stiffness measurement 3 y). One-time post-treatment risk stratification based on noninvasive criteria provides important prognostic information that is maintained during long-term follow-up, as the hazards remain proportional over time.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLongitudinal response to standard of care in pediatric metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease: Rates of improvement and worsening, and factors associated with outcomes.\r\n This study developed criteria for improvement and worsening in children with MASLD over one and two years of follow-up. With SOC, over one-quarter of children are likely to improve while one-fifth of children are likely to worsen. Targeting interventions that affect BMI and lipid parameters may help improve MASLD over time.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPrevention of liver cancer in the era of next-generation antivirals and obesity epidemic.\r\nCholangiocarcinoma prevention may advance with recent efforts to elucidate risk factors. These advances will collectively lead to substantial improvements in liver cancer mortality rates.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe immunological landscape of primary biliary cholangitis: Mechanisms and therapeutic prospects.\r\nIn this review we aim to provide the most recent evidence on the immunopathogenesis of PBC. We will analyse the immune function of the biliary epithelium, assessing the immunomodulatory functions of the bile acids and the evidence of the immunological roles of the secretory pathways targeted by the current treatments.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nUbiquitination of TFEB increased intestinal permeability to aggravate metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis.\r\nThe ubiquitination of TFEB plays a pivotal role in increasing intestinal permeability and promoting the progression of MASH by inhibiting autophagy. Intestinal TFEB may represent a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of MASH.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    AZD2693, a PNPLA3 antisense oligonucleotide, for the treatment of MASH in 148M homozygous participants: two randomized phase I trials.\r\nAZD2693 reduced liver PNPLA3 with an acceptable safety and tolerability profile. These findings support the continued development of AZD2693. Clinical trial number NCT04142424, NCT04483947 IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS  Clinical treatment options for MASH are limited. The genetic risk factor with the largest effect size for progressing to poor liver-related outcomes in MASH is a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the gene PNPLA3 (p.I148M). In Phase 1 SAD and MAD studies, AZD2693, a liver-targeted antisense oligonucleotide was well tolerated, reduced liver PNPLA3 mRNA and protein levels, and dose dependently reduced liver fat content in homozygous PNPLA3 148M risk allele carriers. These data support continued development of AZD2693 as a potential precision medicine treatment for MASH. The Phase 2b FORTUNA study is now ongoing.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCirculating monocytes upregulate CD52 and sustain innate immune function in cirrhosis unless acute decompensation emerges.\r\n CD52 may represent a biologically relevant target for future immunotherapy. Stabilising CD52 may enhance monocyte functions and infection control in the context of cirrhosis, guided by sCD52/PLC as biomarkers indicating immuneparesis. Impact and implications Monocyte dysfunction substantially contributes to infection susceptibility which determines the prognosis of cirrhosis patients, and represents a critical condition with unmet therapeutic needs. Its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood, although among hepatologists a better understanding of the monocyte pathophysiology in relation to cirrhosis stages, and a therapeutic reconstitution of monocyte function are believed to enhance defence against infection and thus reduce morbidity and mortality of patients with cirrhosis in the future. By systematically delineating the heterogeneity and function of circulating monocytes ex vivo, we identified that the absence of CD52 expression on monocytes represented a distinct biomarker of monocyte dysfunction in patients with cirrhosis, discriminating patients at substantial risk for infectious complications. Otherwise, given the beneficial antimicrobial functions of CD52-expressing monocytes, CD52-stablisation may also represent such a target for immunotherapy worth exploring, at it has been desired in clinical practise.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMicrobiota transplant for hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhosis: The THEMATIC trial.\r\nIn a Phase 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial in cirrhosis with HE on maximal therapy, FMT regardless of dose, route, or donor was safe without any FMT-related adverse events. On post-hoc analysis, groups differed on HE recurrence, which was highest in the placebo-only group and linked with lower baseline Lachnospiraceae and reduced donor engraftment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPredictors of hepatic flares after nucleos(t)ide analogue cessation - Results of a global cohort study (RETRACT-B study).\r\nMultivariable analyses showed that older age (aHR 1.02, p = 0.001), male sex (aHR 1.57, p = 0.003), HBsAg levels at NA withdrawal (100-1,000 IU/ml;  aHR 1.99, p IU/ml within the first 12 weeks.

This promotes HCC tumor formation and provides a synthetic lethal link for PARPi therapy. Impact and implications Reduced tumor suppressor protein FBXW7 expression is pivotal in HCC pathogenesis and other liver diseases. However, the regulatory mechanism governing FBXW7 protein expression remains elusive. Herein, we unveil a non-canonical spliced isoform of the ubiquitin receptor ADRM1 that selectively degrades FBXW7 protein, thereby promoting the premalignant transformation of hepatic cells and conferring growth advantages to HCC tumors. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that ADRM1-ΔEx9-expressing HCC tumors exhibited sensitivity to Olaparib in a dose-dependent manner, implicating the potential use of Olaparib in targeting ADRM1-ΔEx9-driven HCC growth.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTGM2-mediated histone serotonylation promotes HCC progression via MYC signalling pathway.\r\nTGM2 serves as a prognostic biomarker and targeting its transglutaminase activity may be an effective strategy for inhibiting HCC progression.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Neurogastroenterol Motil\r\n    Association Between Functional Dyspepsia and Binge Eating Disorder: A Frequent, Often Overlooked Overlap Clinical Presentation.\r\nBED patients have a high prevalence of dyspepsia with an association between postprandial fullness and this eating disorder.

Targeting paracrine senescence may be a way to improve donor hepatocyte function, optimise therapy and guide translation into the clinics. Impact and implications Hepatocyte transplantation has shown promise for genetic diseases but has limited efficacy for acute and severe liver injury. Poor engraftment and functionality inhibit wide-spread clinical application. We show that host senescence provides a required non-competitive niche for donor hepatocytes to repopulate the recipient liver, but can paradoxically, negatively impact donor function.
