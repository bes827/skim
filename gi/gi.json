It seems worthwhile to perform EUS prior to ERCP in the same session.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAssessment of safety and patency of 7-mm covered metal stents for preoperative biliary drainage in pancreatic cancer: Prospective multicenter study.\r\nThe 7-mm MS did not reduce incidence of pancreatitis among surgical candidates for PC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDay before late regimen vs standard split dose of low-volume PEG-CS for early morning colonoscopy: Multicenter randomized controlled trial.\r\nAlbeit more tolerable, the DBL regimen was less effective than the SD regimen with regard to successful bowel cleansing for colonoscopies between 8 am and 10 am. Subgroup analysis on colonoscopies scheduled before 9 am showed that the two regimens have similar efficacy, suggesting that the DBL regimen may be a valuable alternative to the SD regimen for very early morning colonoscopies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEUS-guided gallbladder drainage vs dual stent transpapillary gallbladder drainage for management of acute cholecystitis.\r\nThis study demonstrates that DSET-GBD has similarly low rates of recurrent acute cholecystitis compared with EUS-GBD. DSET-GBD should be considered as an alternative management strategy for management of acute cholecystitis in patients who are unable to undergo CCY.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEUS-guided rendezvous is a viable salvage technique for failed billiary cannulation in patients with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass undergoing BAE-ERCP.\r\nEUS-RV in patients with RYGB has high technical and clinical success and can be a viable alternative to more invasive options when BAE-ERCP fails using traditional cannulation techniques.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEfficacy and safety of H-APC in Barrett's esophagus: Italian prospective multicenter study. \r\nRegarding tolerability, mean pain score was 1.3 (SD 1.99) whereas mean dysphagia score was 1.28 (SD 0.56). The H-APC technique showed promising results in terms of effectiveness and safety with good tolerability in achieving initial CE-IM and CE-D in a selected population of BE patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEfficacy and safety of conservative treatment for colonic diverticular bleeding: Prospective study.\r\nConservative treatment for non-severe colonic diverticular bleeding is appropriate and efficient.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopic and clinical characteristics of autoimmune atrophic gastritis: Retrospective study.\r\n This study offers insights into the clinical, laboratory, and magnifying endoscopic features of patients with AIG. It demonstrates the three main magnifying endoscopic appearances of AIG and highlights the significant prevalence of gastric neoplasia, even in the low-risk Western population. These findings emphasize the importance of the endoscopic exam in identifying AIG and notably present the key magnifying endoscopy findings in a Western setting for the first time.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopic blind limb reduction with septotomy for the treatment of candy cane syndrome after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: Pilot feasibility study.\r\nEBLR may be a potentially safe, efficacious, and cost-effective alternative to surgery in patients with CCS. Further prospective studies are needed.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopic mucosal resection defect inspection for predicting recurrences: International image-based survey. \r\nThis study shows that recurrences after presumed complete EMR can reasonably well be predicted by both experienced and less experienced endoscopists when evaluating images with mucosal defects. Thorough inspection of the post-EMR defect may reduce recurrence rates by recognizing and subsequent treatment of suspect areas.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopic transpapillary gallbladder drainage is associated with favorable long-term outcomes in patients with advanced liver disease. \r\nTranspapillary gallbladder stenting is technically feasible and associated with high rates of clinical success in patients with decompensated liver disease. Stone resolution is common after transpapillary gallbladder stenting and may portend favorable patient outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopic transpapillary gallbladder stenting vs percutaneous cholecystostomy for managing acute cholecystitis: Nationwide propensity score study. \r\nERCP was consistently associated with lower rates of post-procedural AEs compared with PCT including acute hypoxemic respiratory failure ( P < 0.001), acute renal failure ( P < 0.001), shock ( P < 0.001), and need for blood transfusions ( P < 0.001). Our nationwide analysis revealed that ERCP-guided gallbladder drainage should be the preferred approach for managing acute cholecystitis when unfit for surgery.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFeasibility of a novel 5F plastic stent in endoscopic transpapillary gallbladder drainage for acute cholecystitis. \r\nThe median time to late AE was 238 days for the 7F group and 187 days for the 5F group, with no significant difference. A 5F stent can provide outcomes comparable to those of a 7F stent and help prevent hyperamylasemia.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGender disparity in hepatobiliary endoscopy training and delivery: Results of a nationwide survey.\r\nGender disparity in HPB endoscopy exists and is stark. Underlying this are attitudes, assumptions, and environmental factors that will require systemic and sustained correction. Ideas about how to address this challenge need to be explored.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHybrid percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (Hybrid PEG) improves patient safety by combining pull-through technique with gastropexy. \r\nHybrid PEG and direct puncture are equally safe PEG insertion techniques, with significantly better safety profiles than the pull-through technique. Despite the retrospective design of the study, these results suggest preferential use of hybrid PEG due to handling.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImprovement in adenoma detection rate by artificial intelligence-assisted colonoscopy: Multicenter quasi-randomized controlled trial. \r\nAI-assisted colonoscopy significantly increased ADR by 12.5% overall, with a notable 16.3% increase in the screening population. The unchanged NNRR indicates that the higher PDR was due to increased ADR, not unnecessary resections.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIngestible sensor capsule with extended battery capacity allows early diagnosis of GI malignancy in comorbid patients with occult bleeding and anemia.\r\nThe second generation with an extended battery capacity of 9 hours opens the possibility of detecting blood in the middle and lower gastrointestinal tract. Herein we report another advantage of the extended battery capacity allowing noninvasive bleeding detection in the middle and lower gastrointestinal tract, leading to early endoscopic diagnosis of gastrointestinal malignancies with occult bleeding in comorbid patients with severe anemia.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNovel device for blunt dissection in third space endoscopy: Preliminary animal study (with video).\r\nBlunt dissection using our device was feasible, safe, and potentially effective in third space endoscopy procedures by shortening operating time, reducing submucosal injections, and potentially minimizing muscle layer injury.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOptimizing duodenal tissue acquisition for mechanistic studies of duodenal ablation in type 2 diabetes.\r\nDuodenal cold snare resection is safe and can provide high-quality tissue for optimally oriented TMAs and high-quality tissue dissociation scores for scRNA-seq (, NCT06333093, NCT05984238). This approach will allow mechanistic studies about the effects of duodenal ablation on metabolic syndrome and T2D.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPediatric cylindrical battery ingestion. \r\nAccording to our study data, conservative management may be advised for the majority of cases of CB ingestion. However, we acknowledge that CB should be timely removed whenever they are A23 or A27 type, damaged prior to ingestion, in cases of multiple ingestion, whenever retained in the stomach for a prolonged period, or whenever a child complains about any clinical signs or symptoms or had undergone prior abdominal surgery.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReal-world effectiveness and safety of 1L polyethylene glycol and ascorbic acid for bowel preparation in patients aged 80 years or older. \r\nAt least one AE was experienced by 4.5% of participants, the most frequent being mild dehydration (2.8%) and nausea (1.2%). This post-hoc analysis confirms 1L PEG-ASC to be an effective and safe bowel cleansing preparation for patients aged 80 years or older in a real-world setting.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReassessment reveals underestimation of infiltration depth in surgical resection specimens with lymph-node positive T1b esophageal adenocarcinoma.\r\nOur findings highlight the potential for underestimating tumor depth of invasion and other high-risk features in surgical specimens. Despite the limited cohort size, our study confirmed a consistent high-risk histological profile across al cases. Caution is warranted when extrapolating LNM risk data from historic heterogeneous cross-sectional surgical cohorts to the modern ER era.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSustained success in endoscopic performance demonstrated by the Irish National Endoscopy Quality Improvement Programme. \r\nSustaining this improvement and continuing to capture national endoscopic performance will remain a core role of the Irish NEQI program. Workforce imbalances and minimum annual volumes continue to represent challenges for national endoscopy programs.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTechnical outcomes between a drill dilator and ultra-tapered mechanical dilator during EUS-guided pancreaticogastrostomy: Comparative study. \r\nMean procedure time was shorter in the Tornus ES group (13.38±3.80 min) compared with the ES dilator group (21.40±1.54 min) ( P =0.0013). In conclusion, Tornus ES might be considered as the initial dilation device during EUS-PGS.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nUse of the mini-forceps traction-assisted cannulation technique when standard ERCP methods fail: Single-center retrospective study.\r\nMFTAC is a feasible salvage approach for biliary access when standard cannulation methods fail.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nUseful treatment selection strategy for endoscopic hemostasis in colonic diverticular bleeding according to endoscopic findings (with video). \r\nDirect clipping when placement of clips at the bleeding point is feasible and EBL when direct clipping is not feasible is a reasonable strategy in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and safety. Selection of hemostatic method according to the visual field of SRH and maneuverability of the endoscope allows the advantages of both methods to be realized.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopy\r\n    Biliary drainage prior to pancreatoduodenectomy with Endoscopic Ultrasound-guided choledochoduodenostomy vs conventional Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography: a propensity score matched study and surgeon-survey.\r\n This early experience suggests that preoperative biliary drainage with EUS-CDS does not increase the rate of complications after pancreatoduodenectomy and only infrequently hampers surgical exploration.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopic Vacuum Therapy for the Management of Non-Variceal Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding: A Valuable Resource for the Endoscopist's Toolbox.\r\n EVT appears to be safe and effective in the management of NVUGIB. This approach could be particularly useful in refractory or diffuse bleeding. Larger studies are warranted to validate these findings.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopic ultrasound-guided tissue sampling: European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) Technical and Technology Review. \r\nMIAB could represent the first choice for smaller lesions (<20 mm) if proper expertise is available. ESGE does not recommend the use of antibiotic prophylaxis before EUS-guided tissue sampling of solid masses and EUS-FNA of pancreatic cystic lesions.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImpact of Endoscopic Ultrasound-guided biliary drainage on the management of difficult biliary cannulation in patients with distal malignant biliary obstruction.\r\nThe risk of AEs is higher in patients with DMBO, and DBC, this appears to be mainly related to the advanced cannulation techniques. In patients with dilated CBD (>12mm) \"early\" EUS-BD may minimize the risk of adverse events.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLeaving colorectal polyps in situ with endocytoscopy assisted by computer-aided diagnosis: a cost-effectiveness study. \r\nBoth endoscopist-alone and CADx-assisted optical diagnosis reduce colonoscopy costs. The risk of missed adenomas and surveillance interval deviations appear marginal.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPartial ampullary endoscopic mucosal resection in patients with difficult biliary cannulation: A prospective cohort study. \r\n PA-EMR is an effective and safe rescue technique in patients with difficult biliary cannulation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReversible endoscopic gastroduodenal bypass: Endoscopic ultrasound-guided gastro-jejunostomy with pyloric exclusion for the treatment of persistent duodenal leaks after failed surgical repair. \r\nREGB is a technically feasible, reversible, and minimally invasive alternative for managing post-surgical duodenal leaks. Further studies are needed to validate its safety and efficacy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Electroacupuncture Reduces Duration of Postoperative Ileus After Laparoscopic Gastrectomy for Gastric Cancer: A Multicenter Randomized Trial.\r\nEA was superior to SA and standard care only for reducing POI duration and the risk of prolonged POI in patients undergoing laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer (Trial number  ChiCTR2100050660).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPsychological stress-induced local immune response to food antigens increases pain signaling across the gut in mice.\r\nPsychological stress induces a type 2 immune response to food antigens, with IgE-mediated mast cell activation and increased pain signaling in the small intestine and colon in response to food. These findings may explain the potential role of psychological stress in food-induced symptoms in IBS.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    Natural course of high-grade dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus: a scoping review and case-series.\r\n The lag-time between the diagnosis of HGD and progression to clinically-evident EAC varied from 1.5 to 10 years. EET for BE with HGD in patients with less than 3 years of life expectancy seems unlikely to be beneficial. These results may guide management decisions for patients with BE. NL7039;  CRD42022362088.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSafety of Same-Day Discharge After Gastric Peroral Endoscopic Myotomy in Patients with Refractory Gastroparesis: An International Multi-Center Study.\r\nG-POEM is safe with low incidence of AEs and 15-day readmission rates.

Synergistic application of anti-S100A9 or TLR4/RAGE inhibitors with anti-PD-L1 therapy holds great promise as an effective combinational treatment strategy for ETV5-positive HCC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGene score to quantify systemic inflammation in patients with acutely decompensated cirrhosis. \r\nACLF developed during hospitalisation in 80% of patients with a CLIF-SIG score >0.386 on admission. In patients with ADC, the CLIF-SIG score is an accurate estimator of SI, clinical course severity and prognosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut microbial-derived N-acetylmuramic acid alleviates colorectal cancer via the AKT1 pathway. \r\nThe PGF NAM protects against intestinal tumourigenesis by targeting the AKT1 signalling pathway. NAM may serve as a novel potential preventive and therapeutic biomarker against CRC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMulticentre randomised controlled trial of a self-assembling haemostatic gel to prevent delayed bleeding following endoscopic mucosal resection (PURPLE Trial).\r\n The application of a haemostatic gel following EMR of large flat lesions in the duodenum and colorectum does not reduce the rate of delayed bleeding.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSerological screening for coeliac disease in an adult general population: the HUNT study. \r\nThe TG2 IgA assay showed excellent abilities as a screening tool for CeD in the adult general population. However, the diagnostic accuracy of TG2 IgG was too poor for selectively identifying individuals with CeD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    Assessment of liver injury potential of investigational medicines in drug development. \r\nWhile these approaches have been successful in dramatically reducing the marketing approval of medications eventually associated with hepatotoxicity, many challenges remain in identifying the risk for DILI during preclinical and early-to-late clinical development stages for genetic medicines, biological agents, and immunotherapies. In this review, we discuss current preclinical, in-silico, and clinical development approaches to screen for DILI potential of an investigational agent and provide a high-level description of regulators' approach for assessing DILI risk in an NDA.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIntegrative transcriptome profiling elucidates molecular and immunovascular characteristics of macrotrabecular hepatocellular carcinoma. \r\nSingle-cell analysis has deepened our understanding of the molecular mechanism and tumor microenvironment in aggressive HCC. The combination of targeting tumor vasculature and blocking immune checkpoints represents a promising therapeutic strategy for this subtype.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRepression of the ERRγ-CYP2E1 pathway by fibroblast growth factor 4 mitigates alcoholic liver injury. \r\nOur study identifies FGF4 as a stress-responsive regulator in liver pathophysiology, operating via an FGFR4-mediated ERRγ-CYP2E1 signaling pathway. These results underscore the potential of FGF4 and its downstream pathways as therapeutic targets for ALD treatment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSelective genetic inactivation of Caspase 8 in hepatocytes ameliorates progression of MASH following Jnk deficiency. \r\nThis process is mainly mediated by Caspase 8-dependent apoptosis, thereby discovering that Caspase 8 is a downstream target of JNK½. Caspase 8 directed therapy in hepatocytes might be a promising treatment for patients with an increased oxidative stress response and MASH.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSpatial single-cell proteomics landscape decodes the tumor microenvironmental ecosystem of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. \r\nFurthermore, a spatial TME deep learning system was developed to predict the prognosis of iCCA patients with high accuracy from a single 1-mm2 tumor sample. This study offers preliminary insights into the spatial TME ecosystem of iCCA, providing valuable foundations for precise patient classification and the development of personalized treatment strategies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nβ-Catenin regulates distinct pathways from YAP and suppresses ONECUT1 to drive hepatoblastoma development in mice and humans. \r\nWe show that suppressing activated β-Catenin could hamper HB progression in vivo by affecting pathways distinct from those regulated by YAP in HB. Inhibition of ONECUT1 expression by β-Catenin might represent a critical molecular event leading to HB formation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    A phase III randomised study of first-line NUC-1031/cisplatin vs. gemcitabine/cisplatin in advanced biliary tract cancer.\r\nNuTide 121 was terminated early due to futility. NUC-1031/cisplatin did not set a new standard in first-line aBTC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDeveloping splice-switching oligonucleotides for urea cycle disorder using an integrated diagnostic and therapeutic platform. \r\nSpecifically, we focus on CD, going from the discovery of a novel splice variant in the SLC25A13 gene with our novel UCD Deep Intronic-Gene Panel, to the development and in vivo validation of an efficacious SSO candidate for the pathogenic splice variant.

An algorithm combining rule-based NLP with cardiometabolic risk factors and alcohol use from EHRs accurately identifies and classifies SLD and can be applied in large epidemiologic studies of SLD in the Veterans Health Administration.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInflammatory Bowel Disease, Periconceptional Disease Activity, and Risk of Major Congenital Anomalies: A Nationwide Cohort Study.\r\n Children of women with IBD had a heightened susceptibility to mCAs, although absolute and relative risks were lower than previously reported. IBD activity was not linked to mCA risks, but those analyses included relatively few events.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMolecular Triggers of Non-celiac Wheat Sensitivity: A Scoping Review and Analysis.\r\n Gluten is the most extensively investigated wheat component linked to NCWS, but evidence for its role is inconsistent and undermined by methodological limitations. No direct evidence currently links wheat fermentable carbohydrates, ATIs, or other components to NCWS symptoms. The existing evidence is insufficient to justify restricting specific components of wheat in the management of NCWS. Future studies must overcome the identified gaps to rigorously investigate the role of wheat and related cereals in NCWS, with the potential to advance diagnosis and treatment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRisk of Post-polypectomy Bleeding After Colorectal Endoscopic Mucosal Resection in Patients With Cirrhosis: A Propensity-Matched Analysis of the US Collaborative Network. \r\nOptimizing patients with cirrhosis, especially with decompensated disease, before colorectal EMR and monitoring for post-procedure bleeding remain important.

The risk became virtually similar to the background population from 11 years after treatment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Moonlighting Function of GLS2 Promotes Immune Evasion of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma by TTLL1-mediated YAP1 Glutamylation. \r\nFurthermore, GLS2-K151 acetylation and YAP1 E100 glutamylation levels correlated positively with PD-L1 expression and poor prognosis in PDAC patients. The present study revealed a novel mechanism by which hypoxia upregulates PD-L1 expression and highlighted the involvement of GLS2 in non-canonical metabolic pathways involved in tumour immune evasion, with implications for PDAC treatment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    Endoscopist adenoma detection rate associated with neoplasia detection during subsequent-round colonoscopy in fecal immunochemical test-based colorectal cancer screening: cross-sectional analysis of the SCREESCO randomized controlled trial.\r\n The impact of endoscopists' ADRs on ACN detection in subsequent-round colonoscopies underscores the importance of considering ADR for optimal follow-up after first-round colonoscopy in a FIT-based screening program.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nErgonomic Impact of an Automated Device for Endoscopic Tool Insertion and Transfer. \r\nThese findings suggest that INSERTrument could improve the ergonomics of endoscopic procedures, potentially reducing the incidence of musculoskeletal injuries among endoscopists. Further studies are warranted to explore the long-term benefits and clinical implications of this device in routine endoscopic practice.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLong slim versus conventional self-expandable metallic stent in bilateral endoscopic side-by-side deployment for unresectable malignant hilar biliary obstruction. \r\nThe success rate of endoscopic bilateral revisionary stent insertion in LSMS group was also higher (100% vs 33.3%, P=0.000). Bilateral LSMS placement is a viable option for MHBO patients with advantages of less operative difficulty and easier future re-intervention over conventional SBS stenting.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSURVEILLANCE FINDINGS IN HIGH-RISK PATIENTS AFTER BASELINE COMPUTER-ASSISTED DETECTION COLONOSCOPY: A PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING ANALYSIS.\r\nPatients who had CADe use at baseline colonoscopy had significantly lower rates of metachronous lesions, including advanced adenoma, on surveillance colonoscopy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSafety and efficacy of endoscopic ultrasound-guided pelvic abscess drainage with lumen-apposing metal stents for complicated acute diverticulitis. \r\nEUS-PAD could be considered a safe and effective rescue strategy in case of failed or contraindicated percutaneous approach for the management of complicated AD to reduce the need for urgent surgery. Comparative data is necessary to confirm these observations.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThirty-day hospital admission following high-risk outpatient ERCP: incidence and analysis of risk factors based on a secondary analysis of the Stent Versus Indomethacin trial dataset.\r\nHigh-risk patients who undergo outpatient ERCP and are discharged home are at considerable risk for hospital admission within 30 days and have increased rate of pancreatitis and longer length of hospital stay compared to outpatients admitted to the hospital immediately following ERCP, and some factors may predict this outcome. These findings should influence decision making and informed consent when electing to proceed with high-risk ERCP, recognizing that patients with sphincter of Oddi dysfunction were over-represented in this cohort, which may limit generalizability to a typical ERCP practice.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    Aptamer-directed, nanovesicle-mediated targeting of undruggable molecules in preclinical cholangiocarcinoma models.\r\nHerein, we show that aptamer-directed, nanovesicle-mediated targeting of YAP, LCK, and tafazzin potentiates chemosensitivity in two CCA models when delivered using aptamer-guided milk-derived nanovesicles.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGlobal burden of HBV-related liver disease: Primary liver cancer due to chronic HBV infection increased in over one-third of countries globally from 2000 to 2021. \r\nFrom 2000 to 2021, decreases in HBV-related liver disease incidence and prevalence were observed;  however, more than one-third of countries showed an increase in the incidence of HBV-related PLC. These findings highlight the need for strengthened HBV treatment efforts to reduce the risk of liver cancer.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTargeting protein hyperSUMOylation halts cholangiocarcinoma progression by impairing cancer cell viability and tumor-stroma crosstalk.\r\n Aberrant SUMOylation drives CCA progression by enhancing cell survival, proliferation, and shaping the tumor microenvironment. Targeting SUMOylation shows potential in inhibiting CCA growth, representing a promising therapeutic strategy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    A phase IIb randomised-controlled trial of the FFAR1/FFAR4 agonist icosabutate in MASH. \r\nAlthough the primary endpoint was not met, treatment with icosabutate demonstrated encouraging fibrosis (as measured by both conventional and AI-assisted digital pathology) and non-invasive biomarker data, supporting further development in MASH patients. NCT04052516 IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: • With expression on multiple cells types regulating both glycemic control and liver inflammation, targeting free fatty acid receptors 1 and 4 could offer an attractive approach for the treatment of both fibrosing MASH and it's comorbidities.• Although treatment of F1-F3 MASH patients with oral icosabutate (a FFAR1/FFAR4 agonist) did not meet the pre-defined primary endpoint (MASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis), the overall dataset (including AI-assisted digital pathology) suggest an improvement in fibrosis in treated patients.• Improvements in multiple biomarkers of liver damage, inflammation and glycemic control were observed in response to therapy.• Icosabutate was generally safe and well-tolerated, and the overall data support further testing of icosabutate in MASH patients, in particular those with more advanced disease (F2-F3 fibrosis) and type 2 diabetes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHyodeoxycholic acid ameliorates cholestatic liver fibrosis by facilitating m<sup>6<\/sup>A-regulated expression of a novel anti-fibrotic target ETV4.\r\nThe present study underscores ETV4 as a novel anti-fibrotic target and demonstrates that HDCA remodels ECM by facilitating m 6 A-regulated ETV4 expression, offering potential therapeutic approaches for cholestatic liver fibrosis. Impact and implications This study delves into the underlying mechanisms of cholestatic liver fibrosis and offers potential therapeutic targets. The research highlights ETV4 as a novel anti-fibrotic target and is essential for the therapeutic effects of hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA) against cholestatic liver fibrosis. These findings are important for both the scientific community and patients with cholestatic liver diseases, offering valuable insights for future therapeutic strategies that focus on regulating m 6 A-dependent epigenetic modifications of anti-fibrotic targets like ETV4 and developing new interventions utilizing HDCA.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNumber of people treated for hepatitis C virus infection in 2014-2023 and applicable lessons for new HBV and HDV therapies.\r\nIn the last 10 years, 21% of al HCV infections were treated with DAAs. Regional and temporal variations highlight the importance of active screening strategies. Without program enhancements, the number of treated PLHCV stalled in every country/region which may not reflect a lower prevalence but may instead reflect the diminishing returns of the existing strategies. Impact and implications Long-term hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. Since 2014, these infections can be effectively treated with 8-12 weeks of oral therapies. In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) established targets to eliminate HCV by 2030, which included treatment targets for member countries. The current study examines HCV treatment patterns across 119 countries and regions from 2014 to 2023 to assess the impact of national programs. This study can assist physicians and policymakers in understanding treatment patterns within similar regions or income groups and in utilizing historical data to refine their strategies in the future.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nProtein phosphatase 6 regulates metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis via the mTORC1 pathway. \r\nPPP6C is directly activated by FGF21 via FGFRs/βKlotho and improves MASH features through dephosphorylation of TSC2 in hepatocytes. This study implies that pharmacological approaches, genetic or metabolic factors targeting PPP6C activity may offer attractive prospects for treating liver fibrosis and MASH.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Freiburg Index of Post-TIPS Survival (FIPS) identifies patients at risk for further decompensation and ACLF after TIPS.\r\nThe present study reveals that the FIPS predicts development of further decompensation and ACLF after TIPS implantation.

Poor prognosis was associated with low bile acid synthesis and aberrantly increased liver FGF19. Impact and implications Biliary atresia (BA), a fibro-obliterating biliary disease of infants, remains the most common indication for pediatric liver transplantation caused by rapid progression of liver injury. To identify predictive biomarkers of disease progression and to elucidate the pathophysiology of BA liver injury, we profiled serum bile acids and studied their liver metabolism after Kasai portoenterostomy. Accumulation and altered composition of circulating bile acids predicted progression of liver disease and need for liver transplantation. Patients with poor prognosis showed low bile acid synthesis and abnormal liver expression of fibroblast growth factor 19.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHyodeoxycholic acid ameliorates cholestatic liver fibrosis by facilitating m<sup>6<\/sup>A-regulated expression of a novel anti-fibrotic target ETV4.\r\nThe present study underscores ETV4 as a novel anti-fibrotic target and demonstrates that HDCA remodels ECM by facilitating m 6 A-regulated ETV4 expression, offering potential therapeutic approaches for cholestatic liver fibrosis. Impact and implications This study delves into the underlying mechanisms of cholestatic liver fibrosis and offers potential therapeutic targets. The research highlights ETV4 as a novel anti-fibrotic target and is essential for the therapeutic effects of hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA) against cholestatic liver fibrosis. These findings are important for both the scientific community and patients with cholestatic liver diseases, offering valuable insights for future therapeutic strategies that focus on regulating m 6 A-dependent epigenetic modifications of anti-fibrotic targets like ETV4 and developing new interventions utilizing HDCA.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLoss of SGK1 supports metastatic colonization in hepatocellular carcinoma by promoting resistance to T cell-mediated immunity.\r\nThese findings establish SGK1 as a crucial regulator of immune-mediated control over metastatic growth in HCC. SGK1 expression in metastatic lesions may serve as a predictive biomarker for response to immune checkpoint inhibitors, presenting new avenues for therapeutic intervention to overcome immune resistance in metastatic HCC. Impact and implications Despite metastasis is a common occurrence and lethal determinant in cancers, the mechanism underlying tumor immune evasion during metastatic seeding is unclear. Our study reveals that loss of Sgk1 renders metastatic tumor cells survival advantages against antitumor immune response by abrogating CD8 + T cell-induced RIPK1-dependent necroptosis. Growth of Sgk1-silenced metastasis led to infiltration of terminally exhausted CD8 + T cells, which could be reversed by immune checkpoint inhibitors administered at early stage of metastatic seeding. These findings provide valuable insights into potential therapeutic strategies targeting resistance to T cell immunity in cancer metastasis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMultiomic analysis uncovers a continuous spectrum of differentiation and Wnt-MDK-driven immune evasion in hepatoblastoma. \r\nOur novel findings, revealing a continuous spectrum of tumor differentiation states and Wnt-MDK-driven immune evasion, are significant for pediatric oncology clinicians and researchers, improving our functional understanding of the immune environment of hepatoblastoma. The identification of midkine as a tumor-specific immunomodulator suggests a potential for developing new targeted therapies, though further mechanistic and practical validation would be needed to realize clinical translation of these findings.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNumber of people treated for hepatitis C virus infection in 2014-2023 and applicable lessons for new HBV and HDV therapies.\r\nIn the last 10 years, 21% of al HCV infections were treated with DAAs. Regional and temporal variations highlight the importance of active screening strategies. Without program enhancements, the number of treated PLHCV stalled in every country/region which may not reflect a lower prevalence but may instead reflect the diminishing returns of the existing strategies. Impact and implications Long-term hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. Since 2014, these infections can be effectively treated with 8-12 weeks of oral therapies. In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) established targets to eliminate HCV by 2030, which included treatment targets for member countries. The current study examines HCV treatment patterns across 119 countries and regions from 2014 to 2023 to assess the impact of national programs. This study can assist physicians and policymakers in understanding treatment patterns within similar regions or income groups and in utilizing historical data to refine their strategies in the future.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Freiburg Index of Post-TIPS Survival (FIPS) identifies patients at risk for further decompensation and ACLF after TIPS. \r\nThese events are responsible for impaired transplant-free survival in FIPS high-risk patients.
