A larger follow-up study is justified to corroborate these findings. Clinical trial number NCT04066400.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nVon Willebrand factor for outcome prediction within different clinical stages of advanced chronic liver disease.\r\n VWF is the only biomarker that gradually increases across al ACLD stages. It is of particular prognostic value in cACLD, where a CRP/VWF-based model is equivalent to an invasive HVPG-based model. Systematic differences in VWF underline the importance of interlaboratory surveys. Moreover, our findings reinforce the notion that, already in cACLD, inflammation is a key disease-driving mechanism.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAm J Gastroenterol\r\n    A MINORITY OF CHILDHOOD DISORDERS OF GUT-BRAIN INTERACTION PERSIST INTO ADULTHOOD: A RISK-FACTOR ANALYSIS.\r\nChildhood DGBI persist into adulthood in 10-20% of patients, suggesting that management monitoring should continue into adulthood. Those diagnosed with anxiety or mood disorders in childhood should receive particular attention and prescription of NSAIDs in children should be made judiciously.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDiagnostic efficacy of a novel rotating brush for endoscopic sampling of malignant biliary strictures: a multicenter prospective study.\r\nThe RIS brush was a promising tool for effective and safe MBSs sampling and diagnosis.

The proteomic method can readily be implemented by non-expert laboratories in parallel to histology assessment and easily scaled for clinical trial settings.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCeliac disease-related conditions: Who to test?\r\nCeD serology should be the initial step in the screening process. However, for patients with any of the aforementioned disorders who are undergoing upper endoscopy, biopsies should be performed to rule out CeD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGenetic Deletion of Galectin-3 Inhibits Pancreatic Cancer Progression and Enhances the Efficacy of Immunotherapy.\r\nGAL3 promotes PDAC progression and immunosuppression via both cancer cell-intrinsic and immune-related mechanisms. Combined treatment targeting GAL3, CXCL12-CXCR4 axis, and PD-1 represents a novel therapeutic strategy for PDAC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSacral neural crest-independent origin of the enteric nervous system in mouse.\r\nsNCCs do not contribute to the murine ENS, suggesting that the mammalian ENS exclusively originates from vNCCs. These results have immediate implications for comprehending (and devising treatments for) congenital ENS disorders, including Hirschsprung's disease.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTHORACOABDOMINAL WALL MOTION-GUIDED BIOFEEDBACK TREATMENT OF ABDOMINAL DISTENSION: A RANDOMIZED PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL.\r\n Abdominothoracic wall movements serve as an effective biofeedback signal for correcting abdominophrenic dyssynergia and abdominal distention in patients with disorders of the gut-brain interaction. ClincialTrials.gov number, NCT04043208.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    Comparison of lumen apposing metal stents versus endoscopic balloon dilation for the management of benign colorectal anastomotic strictures.\r\nLAMS appears to be as effective as EBD for the treatment of BCAS but may require fewer procedures and may be safer than EBD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nContributions of early detection and cancer prevention to colorectal cancer mortality reduction by screening colonoscopy: a validated modelling study.\r\nReduction of CRC mortality mainly arises from early detection of prevalent cancers during the early years after screening colonoscopy, but prevention of incident cases accounts for the majority of prevented deaths in the longer run. Prevention of incident cases leads to sustained strong reduction of colorectal cancer mortality, possibly warranting an extension of screening intervals.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopic Submucosal Dissection for Early Esophageal Adenocarcinoma: Low Rates of Metastases in Mucosal Cancers with Poor Differentiation.\r\nDuring long-term follow-up the risk of metastasis is low after ER of mucosal EAC with PD as single risk factor. A conservative approach seems justified in this small patient group. However, the treatment strategy has to be determined on an individualized basis until further prospective data are available.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopic submucosal dissection with adaptive traction strategy: first prospective multicenter study.\r\nThis prospective evaluation confirms the efficacy and safety of the adaptive traction strategy with the ATRACT device for colorectal ESD with high resection speed.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInitial Experience with Duodenoscopes with Single-Use End Caps in Pediatric Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography: Infection Prevention Comes at a Cost.\r\nWe report difficulty with advancement, greater reliance on advanced cannulation techniques, and higher rates of PEP when using duodenoscopes with single-use end caps in pediatric ERCP. This area warrants further study.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInterobserver agreement of current and new proposed endoscopic scores for postoperative recurrence in Crohn's disease.\r\n The interobserver agreement of the mRS is substantial. Similarly, the interobserver agreement is substantial for the updated Rutgeerts' score. According to the REMIND score, the interobserver agreement was substantial for lesions in the neoterminal ileum, whereas only moderate for anastomotic lesions. Since therapeutic decisions in clinical practice are based on these assessments and these scores are used as outcome measure in clinical studies, further improvement of the interobserver agreement is essential.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Use of a Self-Assembling Peptide Gel for Stricture Prevention in the Esophagus after Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection: A U.S. Multicenter Prospective Study.\r\n We demonstrate that SAP gel application was easy, quick, and associated with a relatively low stricture rate comparable to other prophylactic methods. Additional comparative studies are needed to corroborate these preliminary findings.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    PNPLA3 fatty liver allele was fixed in Neanderthals and segregates neutrally in humans.\r\nGenome-wide association studies identified p. I148M.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFunction of mast cell and bile-cholangiocarcinoma interplay in cholangiocarcinoma microenvironment.\r\n Bile HA is released from MCs through DMPD stimulation and degraded via SLC22A3 import. Different HA receptors exhibit a distinct expression profile in CCA and produce different oncogenic effects. MCs promote CCA progression in a CCA-bile interplay pattern.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    Early onset of pathological polyploidization and cellular senescence in hepatocytes lacking RAD51 creates a pro-fibrotic and pro-tumorigenic inflammatory microenvironment.\r\nOur results demonstrate a novel function of RAD51 in liver development, homeostasis and tumorigenesis. The Rad51-CKO mice represent a unique genetic model for premature liver senescence, fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinogenesis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFeasibility of hepatitis C elimination by screening and treatment alone in high-income countries.\r\nCurrent risk-based screening, and subsequent treatment, will be inadequate to achieve WHO goals. With extensive scale-up in screening, and treatment, the mortality target may be achievable, but the target for preventing new CHC cases is unlikely reachable, highlighting the importance of developing enhanced harm-reduction strategies for HCV elimination.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImpact of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential on hepatocellular carcinoma in individuals with steatotic liver disease.\r\nWe observed an independent association between CHIP, particularly related to non-DNTM3A and TET2 genetic lesions, and MASLD-HCC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInhibition of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 and liver-related complications in individuals with diabetes: A mendelian randomization and population-based cohort study.\r\nBoth Mendelian randomizations using two European cohorts and a Korean nationwide population-based cohort study suggest that SGLT2 inhibition is associated with a lower risk of liver-related events.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIntrahepatic immunoglobulin a complex induces polarization of cancer-associated fibroblasts to matrix phenotypes in the tumor microenvironment of hepatocellular carcinoma.\r\nIntrahepatic IgA induced polarization of HCC-CAFs into more malignant matrix phenotypes and attenuates cytotoxic T cell function. Our study highlighted their potential roles in tumor progression and immune suppression.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRestoring SRSF3 in Kupffer cells attenuates obesity-related insulin resistance.\r\nRestoring SRSF3 abundance in KCs offers a strategy against obesity-associated tissue inflammation and insulin resistance by preventing bacterial DNA accumulation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReversing malnutrition and low muscle strength with targeted enteral feeding in patients awaiting liver transplant: A randomized controlled trial.\r\n Targeted enteral feeding before LT improves HGS, anthropometry and immune function in severely malnourished cirrhotic patients. These findings provide a strong rationale for early consideration of NGF to reverse malnutrition and improve muscle strength. Appropriately powered studies should explore whether NGF can also impact clinically relevant outcomes including pre- and post-transplant mortality.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSafety and efficacy of off-label bulevirtide monotherapy in HDV patients with decompensated Child-B cirrhosis - a real world case series.\r\nThis report on off-label bulevirtide treatment in patients with decompensated HDV cirrhosis shows similar virologic and biochemical response rates as observed in compensated liver disease. Significant improvements were observed on surrogates of hepatic function and portal hypertension. However, this improvement was not seen in al patients. Controlled trials are needed to confirm safety and efficacy of bulevirtide in decompensated HDV-cirrhosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Efficacy of Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy in Patients with Oligometastatic Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Phase II Study.\r\nSABR is an effective and feasible option for oligometastatic HCC, excellently controls local tumors, and improves survival without adversely affecting QOL. Clinical trial number NCT05173610.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndothelial POFUT1 controls injury-induced liver fibrosis by repressing fibrinogen synthesis.\r\nEndothelial POFUT1 prevents injury-induced liver fibrosis by repressing the expression of fibrinogen which function as a profibrotic paracrine signal to activate HSCs. Therapies targeting the POFUT1/NOTCH/HES1/STAT3/fibrinogen axis offer a promising strategy for the prevention and treatment of fibrotic liver diseases.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOne-year transplant-free survival following hospital discharge after ICU Admission for ACLF in the Netherlands.\r\n In this nationwide cohort study, ACLF grade at ICU admission did not independently affect 1-year transplant-free survival after hospital discharge. Instead, age, presence of malignancy and the severity of liver disease played a more prominent role in influencing transplant-free survival after hospital discharge. Impact and implications Patients with Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) often require intensive care unit (ICU) admission for organ support. In these patients' short-term mortality is high, but long-term outcomes of survivors remain unknown. Using a large nationwide cohort of ICU patients, we discovered that the severity of ACLF at ICU admission does not influence one-year transplant-free survival after hospital discharge. Instead, age, malignancy status and overall severity of liver disease are more critical factors in determining their long-term survival.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPkd1l1-deficiency drives biliary atresia through ciliary dysfunction in biliary epithelial cells.\r\nPkd1l1 loss causes both laterality defects and fibro-proliferative EHBD transformation through disrupted ciliary signalling, phenocopying syndromic biliary atresia. Pkd1l1-deficient mice function as an authentic genetic model to study biliary atresia pathogenesis. Impact and implications The syndromic form of biliary atresia is characterized by fibro-obliteration of extrahepatic bile ducts and is often accompanied by laterality defects. The aetiology is unknown, but Pkd1l1 was identified as a potential genetic candidate for syndromic biliary atresia. We found that loss of the ciliary gene Pkd1l1 contributes to hepatobiliary pathology in biliary atresia, exhibited by bile duct hypertrophy, reduced biliary drainage, and liver fibrosis in Pkd1l1-deficient mice. Pkd1l1-deficient mice serve as a genetic model of biliary atresia and reveals ciliopathy as an aetiology of biliary atresia. This model will help scientists uncover new therapeutic approaches for patients with biliary atresia and validate screening for PKD1L1 variants by paediatric hepatologists for diagnostic evaluation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nProspective validation of the EASL management algorithm for acute kidney injury in cirrhosis.\r\nThe application of the EASL AKI algorithm is associated with very good response rates and does not significantly delay initiation of terlipressin therapy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSyngeneic Murine Models with Distinct Immune Microenvironments Represent Subsets of Human Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma.\r\nSyngeneic iCCA models display a tumor genotype-immune microenvironment phenotype correlation with differential responses to FDA-approved immunotherapy. This study underscores the importance of leveraging multiple preclinical models to understand immunotherapy response in different genetic subsets of human CCA.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nValidation of Baveno VII criteria and other non-invasive diagnostic algorithms for clinically significant portal hypertension in hepatitis delta.\r\nStandalone and composite NIT/ diagnostic algorithms are useful for CSPH diagnosis in HDV-cACLD patients. Thus, NIT may be applied to identify and prioritize patients with CSPH for novel antiviral treatments against CHD. Impact and implications Non-invasive tests (NIT) for clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) have been developed to identify compensated advanced chronic liver disease (cACLD) patients at risk for decompensation, but conflicting data has been published regarding the accuracy of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) for the staging of fibrosis in patients infected with hepatitis D virus (HDV). In our study including 51 HDV-cACLD patients, NIT, i.e., most importantly, the ANTICIPATE model based on LSM and platelet count, but also lab-based approaches, i.e., 3P/5P model and the von Willebrand factor to platelet count ratio (VITRO), and spleen stiffness measurement (SSM) yielded high AUROC for CSPH. Moreover, only patients with CSPH or high non-invasively assessed CSPH-risk were at risk for decompensation within two years, and the prognostic value of NIT was confirmed in a validation cohort. Thus, NIT should be applied and updated in yearly intervals in clinical routine to identify HDV-cACLD patients at short-term risk and may guide prioritization for novel antiviral treatment options.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nVan Gogh-like 2 is essential for the architectural patterning of the mammalian biliary tree.\r\nPlanar cell polarity is a critical step in the post-specification sculpture of the bile duct and is essential for establishing normal tissue architecture. Impact and implications Human disease and mouse models have allowed us to define how the mammalian biliary lineage is specified during liver development. Once this relatively simple epithelium has formed though, how it undergoes morphogenesis to form a complex and branched structure is not clear. Similar to other branched tissues such as the liver and kidney the bile ducts use planar cell polarity signalling to coordinate cell movements;  however how these biochemical signals are linked to ductular patterning remains unclear. Here we show that the core planar cell polarity protein, VANGL2 patterns how cell-cell contacts form in the mammalian bile duct and how ductular cells transmit confluent mechanical changes along the length of a duct. This work sheds light on how biological tubes are pattered across mammalian tissues (including within the liver) and will be important in how we promote ductular growth in patients where the duct is mis-patterned or poorly formed.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Editorial: Corticosteroids for severe checkpoint inhibitor-induced liver injury-Not one size fits all?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Gastrointestinal symptoms-A world of differences.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Liver elastography for chronic hepatitis D-the end of liver biopsy?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Shorter course of intravenous terlipressin in acute variceal bleeding - the promise, controversies and future directions.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: The tsunami of steatotic liver disease in India, the Asia-Pacific region and the world.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Using machine learning to predict significant fibrosis in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReview article: Current indications and selection criteria for early liver transplantation in severe alcohol-associated hepatitis.\r\nWhile early liver transplantation for AH has survival benefits, many patients would not have received treatment for alcohol use disorder.

Impact and implications Excessive and/or sustained hepatocyte apoptosis is critical in driving liver inflammation and injury. The mechanisms underlying the regulation of hepatocyte apoptosis in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) remain largely unclear. Here, we found that CD1d expression in hepatocytes substantially decreases and negatively correlates with the severity of liver injury in patients with NASH. We further revealed a previously unrecognized anti-apoptotic CD1d-JAK2-STAT3 signaling axis in hepatocytes, which confers significant protection against liver injury in NASH and acute liver diseases. Thus, hepatocyte CD1d-targeted therapy could be a promising strategy to manipulate liver injury in both NASH and other hepatocyte apoptosis-related liver diseases.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDeficiency in SLC25A15, a hypoxia-responsive gene, promotes hepatocellular carcinoma by reprogramming glutamine metabolism.\r\n SLC25A15 is hypoxia-responsive in HCC, and low SLC25A15 levels result in glutamine reprogramming through SLC1A5 and OGDHL regulation, promoting HCC progression and regulating cell sensitivity to anti-PD-L1. Interrupting the glutamine-derived energy supply is a potential therapeutic strategy for treating SLC25A15-deficient HCC. Impact and implications We first demonstrated the tumor suppressor role of solute carrier family 25 member 15 (SLC25A15) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and showed that its deficiency leads to reprogramming of glutamine metabolism to promote HCC development. SLC25A15 can serve as a potential biomarker to guide the development of precision therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting glutamine deprivation. Furthermore, we highlight that the use of an inhibitor of glutamine utilization can enhance the sensitivity of low SLC25A15 HCC to anti-PD-L1 therapy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMultidrug-resistant bacterial infections after liver transplantation: prevalence, impact, and risk factors.\r\n MDR infections are highly prevalent after LT and have a significant impact on prognosis.

These findings offer new insights into preventive and therapeutic interventions for extrahepatic CCA. Impact and implications The aberrant PTEN-PI3K-AKT signaling pathway is commonly observed in human extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (eCCA), a disease with a poor prognosis. In our study, we developed a mouse model mimicking cholangitis to eCCA progression by conditionally deleting the Pten gene via Pdx1-Cre in epithelial cells and peribiliary glands of the extrahepatic biliary duct. The conditional Pten deletion in these cells led to cholangitis, which gradually advanced to dysplasia, ultimately resulting in eCCA. The loss of Pten heightened Akt signaling, cell proliferation, inflammation, fibrosis, DNA damage, epigenetic signaling, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell dysplasia, and cellular senescence. Genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of Aurka successfully halted the disease progression. This model shall be valuable for testing novel therapies and unraveling the mechanisms of eCCA tumorigenesis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSingle cell landscape of functionally cured chronic hepatitis B patients reveals activation of innate and altered CD4-CTL-driven adaptive immunity.\r\nOur study provides conceptually novel insights into the immuno-pathological control of HBV cure, and opens exciting new avenues for clinical management, biomarker discovery and therapeutic interventions.

Therefore, CRKL inhibitors combined with anti-PD-1 may be developed for the treatment of HCC. Impact and implications Here, we found CRKL was overexpressed in anti-PD-1 resistant HCC and CRKL upregulation promotes anti-PD-1 resistance in HCC. We identified that CRKL/β-catenin/VEGFα and CXCL1 axis upregulation contributes to anti-PD-1 tolerance through promoting tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) infiltration. These findings support the strategy of bevacizumab-based ICIs combination therapy, and CRKL inhibitors combined with anti-PD-1 therapy may be developed for the treatment of HCC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSingle cell landscape of functionally cured chronic hepatitis B patients reveals activation of innate and altered CD4-CTL-driven adaptive immunity.\r\nOur study provides conceptually novel insights into the immuno-pathological control of HBV cure, and opens exciting new avenues for clinical management, biomarker discovery and therapeutic interventions.

These features are exacerbated by cirrhotic ECM, highlighting the dual impact of the PNPLA3 I148M variant and the fibrotic microenvironment in progressive chronic liver diseases. Impact and implications Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) play a key role in the fibrogenic process associated with chronic liver disease. The PNPLA3 genetic mutation has been linked with increased risk of fibrogenesis, but its role in HSCs needs further investigation. Here, by using comparative transcriptomic and a novel 3D in vitro model, we demonstrate the impact of the PNPLA3 genetic mutation on primary human HSCs cell behaviour, and we show that it affects the cell's mitochondrial function and antioxidant response, as well as the antifibrotic gene NR4A1. Our publicly available transcriptomic data, 3D platform and our findings on NR4A1 could facilitate the discovery of targets to develop more effective treatments for chronic liver diseases.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Assessment and significance of histologic activity in Crohn disease.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Emerging Role of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists for the Treatment of Metabolic- Dysfunction Associated Steatohepatitis.\r\nThis review summarizes the role of glucagon-like peptide (GLP) -1 receptor agonists in treating MASLD/MASH.
