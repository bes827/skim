When accounting for increased injection drug use, estimated prevalence of hepatitis C is substantially higher than previously reported. National action is urgently needed to expand testing, increase access to treatment, and improve surveillance, especially among medically underserved populations, to support hepatitis C elimination goals.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIdentifying a therapeutic window of opportunity for people living with primary sclerosing cholangitis: Embryology and the overlap of inflammatory bowel disease with immune mediated liver injury.\r\nThis is critical for the optimal targeting of studies into PSC etiopathogenesis and emphasizes the concept of a \"developmental window of opportunity for therapeutic mitigation\" in what is currently recognized as an irreversible disease process. The discovery of such a window would be critically important for the targeting of interventions, both administration of current therapies and therapeutic trial planning.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMASLD/MetALD and mortality in individuals with any cardio-metabolic risk factor: a population based study with 26.7 years of follow-up.\r\n In individuals with CMRF, the presence of steatotic liver disease (MASLD) alone did not increase the risk of mortality, except in cases with more alcohol consumption (MetALD). Therefore controlling metabolic risk factors and reducing alcohol consumption in people with MASLD or MetALD will be crucial steps to improve long-term health outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTargeting cellular cathepsins inhibits hepatitis E virus entry.\r\nIn summary, our study highlights the pivotal role of lysosomal cathepsins, especially CTSL, in the HEV entry process. The profound anti-HEV efficacy of the pan-cathepsin inhibitor, K11777, especially with its notable safety profile in primary cells, further underscores its potential as a therapeutic candidate.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Bulevirtide monotherapy in patients with chronic HDV: Efficacy and safety results through week 96 from a phase 3 randomized trial.\r\nVirologic and biochemical responses were maintained and/or increased with longer-term BLV therapy, including in those with suboptimal early virologic response. BLV monotherapy for CHD was safe and well tolerated through W96. Impact and implications In July 2023, bulevirtide was fully approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis delta (CHD) in Europe based on clinical study results from up to 48 weeks of treatment. Understanding the efficacy and safety of bulevirtide over the longer term is important for healthcare providers. In this analysis, we demonstrate that bulevirtide monotherapy for 96 weeks in patients with CHD was associated with continued improvements in combined, virologic, and biochemical responses as well as liver stiffness from week 48 at both the 2-mg and 10-mg doses. Patients with suboptimal virologic responses to bulevirtide at week 24 also benefited from continued therapy, with the majority achieving virologic response or biochemical improvement by week 96.

Following comprehensive in vitro and clinical data analysis together with input from the expert committee, an evidence-based consensus-driven list of 10 positive and negative drugs is proposed for validating in vitro models for improving preclinical drug safety testing regimes. Impact and implications Prediction of human toxicity early in the drug development process remains a major challenge. For this, human in vitro models are becoming increasingly important, however, the development of more physiologically relevant liver models and careful selection of control DILI+ and DILI- drugs are requisites to better predict DILI liability of new drug candidates. Thus, this systematic study holds critical implications for standardizing validation of new in vitro models for studying drug-induced liver injury (DILI). By establishing a consensus-driven list of positive and negative control drugs, the study provides a scientifically justified framework for enhancing the consistency of preclinical testing, thereby addressing a significant challenge in early hepatotoxicity identification. The results are of paramount importance to al the actors involved in the drug development process, offering a standardized approach to assess hepatotoxic risks. Practically, these findings can guide researchers in evaluating safety profiles of new drugs, refining in vitro models, and informing regulatory agencies on potential improvements to regulatory guidelines, ensuring a more systematic and efficient approach to drug safety assessment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Outcomes of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma treated with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab in real-world clinical practice who met or did not meet the inclusion criteria for the phase 3 IMbrave150 trial.\r\nPatients who are treated with Atezo/Bev and meet the inclusion criteria for the phase 3 IMbrave150 trial, as well as those who do not meet the inclusion criteria but have good liver function, have a good prognosis for survival.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReal-life effectiveness of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir in hepatitis C patients previously treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or glecaprevir/pibrentasvir.\r\n SOF/VEL/VOX is an effective rescue therapy for failures to SOF/VEL or GLE/PIB, with an SVR of 88.6%.

The DY of annual NC-AMRI was significantly higher than that of biannual US, without increasing the FRR. Alternating US and NC-AMRI at 6-month intervals could be an optimal surveillance strategy for high-risk patients. Impact and implications Current guidelines permit the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a surveillance tool for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients in whom ultrasonography (US) is inadequate. However, the specific indications, imaging sequences, and surveillance intervals for MRI surveillance remain unclear. In our study, we found that annual non-contrast (NC)-abbreviated MRI (AMRI) exhibited marginally higher sensitivity and significantly better diagnostic yield than biannual US in high-risk patients for HCC. Adopting alternating US and NC-AMRI at 6-month intervals demonstrated significantly improved sensitivity compared to biannual US, making it a potentially optimal surveillance strategy for high-risk patients.

The DY of annual NC-AMRI was significantly higher than that of biannual US, without increasing the FRR. Alternating US and NC-AMRI at 6-month intervals could be an optimal surveillance strategy for high-risk patients. Impact and implications Current guidelines permit the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a surveillance tool for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients in whom ultrasonography (US) is inadequate. However, the specific indications, imaging sequences, and surveillance intervals for MRI surveillance remain unclear. In our study, we found that annual non-contrast (NC)-abbreviated MRI (AMRI) exhibited marginally higher sensitivity and significantly better diagnostic yield than biannual US in high-risk patients for HCC. Adopting alternating US and NC-AMRI at 6-month intervals demonstrated significantly improved sensitivity compared to biannual US, making it a potentially optimal surveillance strategy for high-risk patients.
