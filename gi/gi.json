Impact and implications This research examines the role of CD4 lymphocytes in controlling bile duct epithelial injury in fibrosing cholangiopathies, with potential implications for developing targeted therapies for biliary atresia and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Using single cell genomics, functional assays, and complementary mouse models of sclerosing cholangitis, mechanisms by which chenodeoxycholic acid derived bile acids determine polarization and suppressor functions of CD4 lymphocytes were investigated. Reduction of hepatic bile acid concentration with IBAT inhibitor, antagonizing STAT3 in CD4 lymphocytes, or blocking of S1P receptors boost hepatic regulator T cells in experimental sclerosing cholangitis and protect from cholestatic liver injury. The preclinical studies will inform future clinical trials in affected patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEfficacy and safety of time-restricted eating in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.\r\nTRE effectively reduces hepatic steatosis in MASLD, with comparable benefits on weight loss, body composition, and metabolic parameters as CR. This approach may serve as a practical dietary strategy for MASLD management.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGlucagon controls obesity-specific energy expenditure via persistent cAMP/PKA signaling.\r\nThese findings provide the molecular basis for GCG-induced energy expenditure and metabolic benefits and suggest the phenotypic segregation of cAMP/PKA-dependent and independent effects. Impact and implications This study provides fundamental mechanistic insights into GCG pharmacology with direct clinical implications. The obesity-specific enhancement of energy expenditure by GCGR agonist substantiates the superior efficacy of GCGR/glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) dual agonists in individuals with obesity compared to GLP-1R mono-agonists. Importantly, differential PDE4 expression patterns may provide a molecular basis for the variable weight-loss responses to GCG-based agonists, identifying PDE4 inhibition as a potential strategy to restore efficacy in GCG-non-responders. Furthermore, the PDE4-overexpression model preserved the lipid-clearing capacity of GCGR agonist while attenuating hyperglycemic risk, demonstrating a translatable strategy to optimize the safety-efficacy profile of GCG-based therapies for cardio-renal-metabolic diseases such as obesity and MASH.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImpact of first and further decompensation in patients with compensated ACLD due to MASLD.\r\nThe first and further decompensations represent tipping points in the clinical course of patients with cACLD due to MASLD, increasing 18.9-times and additionally 1.52-times the cause-specific hazard of LR-D. HCC is an independent predictor of LR-D in patients with cACLD due to MASLD, resulting in an additional cause-specific hazard of LR-D when associated with both first and further decompensation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPolyunsaturated fatty acid-induced metabolic exhaustion and ferroptosis impair the anti-tumour function of MAIT cells in MASLD.\r\nOur findings uncover a novel immunometabolic axis that serves as a functional barrier for MAIT cell-mediated anti-cancer immunity and could be exploited for enhancement of immunotherapy. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS  ;  This study identifies a novel immunometabolic axis by which polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) accumulating in MASLD liver tissue drive MAIT cell dysfunction through lipid peroxide-induced metabolic exhaustion and ferroptosis, thereby impairing their anti-tumour activity. These findings reveal how MASLD creates an immune-permissive environment that may facilitate HCC development and -progression. Targeting the PUFA-lipid peroxide axis could restore MAIT cell function and enhance current immunotherapeutic anti-cancer strategies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRapid whole-blood immune profiling reveals heterogeneous HBV-specific T cell response patterns independent of clinical disease phases.\r\nThe HBV-CRA is an easy-to-use assay that identifies immune profiles associated with HBsAg clearance in AHB and differentiates CHB patients based on antiviral T cell function. Importantly, distinct HBV-specific T cell cytokine patterns were detected independently of conventional clinical disease phases, suggesting that stratifications of CHB patients for immunotherapeutic interventions should be guided by HBV-CRA. Impact and implications Challenges in collecting anti-HBV immune biomarkers from chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients have led us to develop an easy-to-use assay (HBV-CRA) designed to quantify virus-specific T cell function in the patients' whole blood. We show that HBV-CRA can identify immune profiles associated with HBsAg clearance in AHB and reveal functional T cell heterogeneity among CHB patients that is not captured by standard clinical classifications. By offering a scalable, point-of-care immune monitoring tool, HBV-CRA could support the development and implementation of personalized immunotherapeutic strategies in CHB management.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Editorial: Beyond Viral Eradication-Scrutinising Outcomes After Hepatitis C Cure.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReview Article: Drug-Induced Liver Injury Associated With Antibody-Based Therapies in Haematologic Malignancies.\r\nDILI remains a major challenge in the use of antibody-based therapies for haematologic malignancies.

Impact and implications The current subclassification of steatotic liver disease (SLD) relies on self-reported alcohol use, which is frequently limited by patient underreporting, potentially leading to diagnostic misclassification. In this study of 391 community-dwelling adults with overweight/obesity and SLD assessed by advanced MRI methods, we found that 15.9% (95% CI  12.2%-19.5%) of individuals with SLD underreported alcohol use based on their phosphatidylethanol (PEth) levels. Male gender, absence of type 2 diabetes, and White race were the strongest independent factors associated with alcohol underreporting in this population. The incorporation of PEth alongside self-reported alcohol use resulted in a 4-fold increase in MetALD diagnoses and a 3-fold increase in ALD diagnoses. These findings support the clinical utility of PEth as a direct, quantitative, objective alcohol biomarker which may help clinicians identify SLD subcategories and differentiate between its metabolic and alcohol-related etiologies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Editorial: Endomysial Antibodies for a No-Biopsy Diagnosis of Coeliac Disease-The Jury Is Still Out.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Patient Reported Outcomes Provide Insight Into Disease Severity for People Living With Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Shooting in the Dark-The Problem With Empiric Antispasmodics for Abdominal Pain in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReview: Human Intestinal Barrier-Optimal Measurement and Effects of Diet in the Absence of Overt Inflammation or Ulceration.\r\nCurrently, data are not exclusively from human studies, and research is needed to corroborate observations in animals or further validate in humans.

Whilst PFS is currently the best candidate surrogate marker for OS, our results highlight the need for novel endpoints in this field. Impact and implications The use of validated surrogate endpoints in biliary tract cancer trials may decrease costs and improve study feasibility, particularly with agents that only target small subsets of patients or in trials that incorporate a cross-over design. A formal statistical validation of surrogacy requires patient-level and trial-level data. This is the first comprehensive analysis to incorporate novel agents (including immunotherapies and targeted agents), include patient-level data and rigorously and homogeneously extract appropriate measures of treatment effect for endpoint correlation. These results show a moderate correlation for progression-free survival both at the trial- and patient-level and a low correlation for disease-control rate and response rate. This information will aid clinicians in appropriately interpreting contemporary clinical trials and guide clinical researchers and trial sponsors involved in clinical trial design. Furthermore, it has important implications for the regulatory approval process and may aid agencies in appropriately evaluating novel drugs.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAttenuation of the second peak of bimodal recurrence of HBV-related HCC after curative treatment in the antiviral era.\r\n Following curative surgery or ablation, antiviral therapy against HBV is associated with reduction in late recurrence.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDissecting metabolic dysfunction- and alcohol-associated liver disease (MetALD) using proteomic and metabolomic profiles.\r\nThis study emphasizes the importance of subtyping differentiation using proteome data for personalized treatment and improved prognostic outcomes in MetALD patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSteatotic liver disease induces YAP/TAZ-driven cell competition that can suppress tumor initiation.\r\nThese findings reveal that steatotic hepatocytes in early MASLD can activate endogenous cell competition programs to suppress tumor initiation, a process that depends on Yap/Taz activity. This adds a new layer to our understanding of how fitness landscapes and cell-to-cell interactions within the tissue microenvironment shape cancer risk. It also shows that progression of chronic liver disease not only promotes tumorigenesis through effects of inflammation and fibrosis on tumor cells but also by disrupting the competitive defenses of normal surrounding cells. Impact and implications We found that early stages of steatotic liver disease (MASLD) can suppress tumor initiation in mouse models of liver cancer by triggering Yap/Taz-mediated cell competition. This reveals an unexpected tumor-suppressive role for early MASLD and highlights the importance of non-cell autonomous mechanisms during tumor initiation. Since Hippo-YAP/TAZ signaling is deregulated in many cancers, similar cell competition-based mechanisms may operate in other tissues.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Editorial: Clinical Impact of Lipid Profile Change After DAA Treatment in CHC Patients.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEditorial: Time to EXIT?

The results of this trial suggest that acupuncture may serve as an alternative treatment for IBS-D. (ACTION Chinese Clinical Trial Registry number, ChiCTR2100044762).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    Commensal <i>Bacteroides<\/i> T6SS alleviate GI-aGVHD via mediating gut microbiota composition and bile acids metabolism.\r\nT6SS in commensal bacteria could modulate bile acid metabolism, potentially impacting aGVHD outcomes and offering a novel target for therapeutic interventions.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    Bariatric surgery for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD): Current knowledge of mechanisms.\r\nGiven the mounting evidence from preclinical research, clinical trials and advanced biotechnologies emerging in recent years, refined histological and cellular in-depth characterization in MBS-treated MASLD is anticipated. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the pathogenic and therapeutic effects of MBS on MASLD, with the hope of inspiring further mechanistic and translational studies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Personalized survival benefit estimation from living donor liver transplantation with a novel machine learning method for confounding adjustment.\r\nDPSM provides an effective approach for creating RCT-like comparability from observational data to predict which patients will benefit most from LDLT. This novel ML-based methodology enables personalized survival predictions while minimizing confounders and offers clinicians a new tool to more confidently evaluate treatment effects.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Editorial: Chronic Hepatitis B at the Intersection of Immigration, Acculturation and Social Determinants of Health.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    Endoscopic Approaches to Reduce the Incidence of Interval Colon Cancer.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    Gastrointestinal microbiota and inflammasomes interplay in health and disease: a gut feeling.\r\nBesides the standard experimental approaches, this complex network of interactions is now being addressed by Artificial intelligence, which emphasises the profound impact of the gut microbiota on GI health, cancer progression and brain function, opening new avenues for therapeutic intervention in GI diseases, cancer and neurological disorders. Ultimately, microbiota-inflammasome interactions manage a regulatory framework that influences inflammation, cancer progression and systemic diseases, positioning it as both a mediator and a promising therapeutic target in GI malignancies and systemic diseases of the central nervous system.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous\r\nmisc publications eg case reports, tools of the trade, images of\r\nthe month, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Gastroenterol\r\n    PEG Tube Gone Rogue: An Unusual Cause of Acute Pancreatitis.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPill Esophagitis Resulting in Esophageal Mucosal Dissection and Stricture.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPrimary Biliary Cholangitis in 2025: A New Frontier.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Adverse Events After Surveillance Colonoscopy in Older Adults In A Large Integrated Health System in the United States.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopy\r\n    A novel treatment for radiation proctopathy using monopolar spray coagulation with a polypectomy snare tip.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nAn early-detected intraductal papillary squamous neoplasm of the pancreas under peroral pancreatoscopy.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nBe cautious with the semilunar fold!
