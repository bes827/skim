These results support the benefits of STRIDE for participants with uHCC globally, including the Asia-Pacific region. Clinical trial number NCT03298451 IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS  The global, phase III HIMALAYA study found that the STRIDE (Single Tremelimumab Regular Interval Durvalumab) regimen improved overall survival (OS), including long-term OS, vs sorafenib, and that durvalumab monotherapy was noninferior to sorafenib in participants with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC). However, there are differences in the aetiology and clinical practices related to HCC in parts of Asia, compared to Western countries and Japan, which could lead to differences in treatment outcomes between these regions. The results of this analysis demonstrate the benefits of STRIDE for participants in the Asia-Pacific region, consistent with the full, global study population. Overall, these findings continue to support the use of STRIDE in a diverse population, reflective of uHCC globally.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPegIFN alpha-2a reduces relapse in HBeAg-negative patients after nucleo(s)tide analogue cessation: A randomized-controlled trial.\r\nSwitching from NUC to PegIFN-α-2a treatment for 48 weeks significantly reduces virological relapse rates and achieves higher HBsAg loss rates than NUC treatment cessation alone in HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B patients. Impact and implications Nucleo(s)tide analogue (NUC) cessation can lead to HBsAg clearance but also a high rate of virological relapse, but an optimised scheme to reduce the virological relapse rate after NUC withdrawal is yet to be reported. This randomized controlled trial investigated the effect of switching from NUC to PegIFN-α-2a treatment for 48 weeks on virological relapse until week 96 in HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B patients. The interferon monotherapy group had a significantly lower cumulative virological relapse rate (20.8% vs 53.6%, P < 0.0001) and higher HBsAg loss rate (21.5% vs 9.0%, P= 0.03) than the NUC cessation group until week 96. This provides an optimized strategy for NUC cessation in HBeAg-negative patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTransposon-based oncogene integration in Abcb4(Mdr2)-/- mice recapitulates high susceptibility to cholangiocarcinoma in primary sclerosing cholangitis.\r\nMdr2-/-, which features reliable tumor induction in PSC-like background of biliary injury and fibrosis.

These findings challenge preconceived ideas on methotrexate and suggest that it is a valid first-line conventional option for the treatment of mild-to-moderate Crohn's disease.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAm J Gastroenterol\r\n    Using Diet to Treat Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review.\r\n Currently, there is limited evidence to support the use of specific diets to treat adult patients with mildly to moderately active IBD. Larger, randomized studies with standardized methodologies and outcome measures, rigorous adherence assessment, and an emphasis on endoscopic assessment outcome measures are required to validate most diets that have been studied for IBD. The included sample diet plans and dietary recommendations may prove helpful in the interim as part of a holistic strategy to manage patients with IBD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    RISK OF DE NOVO BARRETT'S ESOPHAGUS POST SLEEVE GASTRECTOMY: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF STUDIES WITH LONG TERM FOLLOW UP.\r\n Our analysis shows that SG results in a significantly increased risk of de novo BE and higher rates of EE, PPI use and HH. Our findings suggest that clinicians should routinely screen patients with SG for BE and future surveillance intervals should be followed as per societal guidelines.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Efficacy and safety of risankizumab by baseline corticosteroid use and achievement of corticosteroid-free clinical and endoscopic outcomes in patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease.\r\nEfficacy of risankizumab 600 mg induction therapy was independent of concomitant corticosteroid use. Risankizumab 180 and 360 mg maintenance therapy yielded high rates of corticosteroid-free clinical and endoscopic outcomes at week 52.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLong-term safety and efficacy of filgotinib for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis: Interim analysis from up to 4 years of follow-up in the SELECTION open-label long-term extension study. \r\nSafety results showed a proven long-term benefit-risk profile. FIL200-treated CDC achievers had better long-term outcomes than non-achievers.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPrevalence and prognostic value of zinc and selenium deficiency in advanced chronic liver disease.\r\n Zinc and selenium deficiencies are common in ACLD patients especially with higher MELD and HVPG. Low zinc and selenium levels independently predicted hepatic decompensation and liver-related death. The effect of zinc/selenium supplementation in ACLD should be investigated in future trials.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe effect of dietary emulsifiers and thickeners on intestinal barrier function and its response to acute stress in healthy adult humans: A randomised controlled feeding study.\r\n High intake of emulsifiers improved barrier function in the unstressed state, but increased intestinal permeability to stress, without evidence of inflammation. A LED was protective of the stress effect.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAm J Gastroenterol\r\n    Antigliadin antibodies and the brain in people without celiac disease: a case-control study.\r\nOur analysis is the most comprehensive to date and utilises a number of outcome measures known to be sensitive to subtle shifts in neurophysiology and cognition. Incidental AGA does not appear to be associated with any indications of neuropsychological deficit.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDeep learning model using stool pictures for predicting endoscopic mucosal inflammation in patients with ulcerative colitis.\r\nDLSUC demonstrated a good discriminating power similar to that of Fcal in predicting endoscopic activity with improved accuracy in patients without rectal sparing. This study implies that stool photos are a useful monitoring tool for typical UC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDelivery of Outpatient Cirrhosis Care Via Tele-visit is Not Associated with Increased Mortality as Compared to Traditional In-Person Visits.\r\n Our findings suggest that outpatient cirrhosis care by tele-visit is associated with outcomes no worse than traditional in-person visits. This should reassure providers who hesitate to provide virtual care to patients with cirrhosis due to concerns for poorer outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInpatient Gastroenterology Consults Have Little Utility Prior to Transesophageal Echocardiograms in a Prospective Cohort Study.\r\n Inpatient GI team workups to clear patients for a TEE found no contraindications to TEEs, did not change patient care plans, and led to increased hospital costs and lengths of stay.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLinear-array Endoscopic Ultrasound and Narrow-Banding Imaging Measure the Invasion Depth of Nonpedunculated Rectal Lesions with Comparable Accuracy based on a Randomized Controlled Trial.\r\nLinear EUS and NBI measure the invasion depth of NPRLs with comparable accuracy. The combination of the two methods does not improve the diagnostic accuracy. Single NBI should be preferred, considering its simplicity and convenience in clinical practice.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPrevalence of Preceding and Follow-up Outpatient Care Surrounding Emergency Department Visits for Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Identifying Opportunities for Quality Improvement.\r\n Gaps in preceding and follow-up care signal opportunities to improve care quality.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRisk of Small Intestine Cancer in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Propensity-Matched Study from a Large Multi-Center Database in the United States.\r\n Both patients with CD and, interestingly, UC had an elevated risk for developing SBC compared to the general population.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSevere Cholestasis Predicts Recurrent Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis Following Liver Transplantation.\r\nThe development of cholestasis within 3 to 12 months following LT was predictive of rPSC and graft loss.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Association Between Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitor or Angiotensin Receptor Blocker Exposure and Key Cirrhosis-Related Outcomes.\r\nACE-I/ARB exposure was associated with reduced mortality, potentially through CV and other (renal, malignancy-related) mechanisms. In patients with compensated disease, ACE-I/ARB was not associated with hepatic decompensation or HCC. Future research should identify subsets of patients who benefit from ACE-I/ARB exposure.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Automated Neutrophil Quantification and Histological Score Estimation in Ulcerative Colitis.\r\n The AI system's precise localization and quantification of neutrophils proved valuable for histological assessment and clinical prognosis stratification.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClinical Presentation and Outcomes of Alpha-Gal Syndrome.\r\n A diagnosis of AGS should be strongly considered in patients with a history of tick bites and clinical presentation of allergic or GI manifestations.

Targeting these areas before precise analysis of the lesion could be a way of improving detection of focal malignancies and prediction of the most severe histology.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nEndoscopy\r\n    Effect of Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation Based on Wrist-Ankle Acupuncture Theory for Pain Relief during Non-Anesthetic Colonoscopy: A Randomized Controlled Trial.\r\n TENS-WAA effectively reduces pain during non-anesthetized colonoscopy, especially in male participants, providing a promising non-invasive analgesic method.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Long-term cost-effectiveness of case-finding and mass-screening for coeliac disease in children. \r\nAn earlier identification of CD through screening or case-finding in children using a POCT leads to improved health outcomes and is cost-effective in the long-term compared to current care. If the feasibility and acceptability of the proposed strategies are successful, implementation in Dutch regular care is needed.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMucosal Single-Cell Profiling of Crohn's-Like Disease of the Pouch Reveals Unique Pathogenesis and Therapeutic Targets. \r\nAdditionally, CDP pouch/ileum exhibited heightened endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress across al major cell compartments. CDP likely represents a distinct entity of inflammatory bowel disease with heightened ER stress in both immune and non-immune cells, which may become a novel diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for CDP.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    A prospective randomized controlled trial of water exchange plus cap versus water exchange colonoscopy in unsedated Veterans.\r\nUnsedated colonoscopy was appropriate for unescorted Veterans. WE alone was sufficient. Adding a cap did not reduce RTMIP. Patient specific factors and application of WE with insertion suction of infused water contributed to high and low RTMIP, respectively. For unesorted patients, selecting those with low anxiety, avoiding low body mass index, history of depression or self-reported poor health and adhering to the steps of WE can minimize RTMIP to ensure success of unsedated colonoscopy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAdenoma detection rate and tolerability of two ultra-low volume bowel preparations in screening: a noninferiority randomized controlled trial.\r\nDespite the superior bowel preparation quality associated with 1L-PEGA, the safety, tolerability and overall satisfaction of participants were higher with SPMC.

Thus, HBcrAg may represent an easily and reliably applicable parameter to select patients who are more likely to achieve better response to pegIFN-α add-on to virally suppressed patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImpact of prenatal and postnatal maternal IBD status on offspring's risk of IBD: a population-based cohort study.\r\n Offspring had a greater risk of IBD when either parent was diagnosed before childbirth rather than later, emphasising genetic predisposition and environmental risk factors rather than maternal inflammation in utero as risk factors for IBD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    Acute kidney injury in severe alcohol-associated hepatitis treated with anakinra plus zinc or prednisone.\r\nAKI occurred more frequently and was more severe in A+Z-treated participants. A+Z-treated participants with AKI had higher uNGAL, suggesting that A+Z maybe nephrotoxic in sAH patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAg-driven CD8+ T cell clonal expansion is a prominent feature of MASH in humans and mice.\r\nMASH-induced human cirrhosis and diet-induced MASH in mice resulted in the accumulation of activated and clonally expanded T cells in the liver. The clonally expanded T cells in the liver expressed markers of chronic antigenic stimulation, including PD1, TIGIT, and TOX. Overall, this study establishes for the first time that T cells undergo Ag-dependent clonal expansion and functional differentiation during the progression of MASH. These studies could lead to the identification of antigenic targets that drive T cell activation, clonal expansion, and recruitment to the liver during MASH.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCX3CR1+ macrophages interact with hepatic stellate cells to promote hepatocellular carcinoma through CD8+ T cell suppression.\r\n We showed that CX3CR1+Ly6C+ macrophages migrate and interact with aHSCs in the peritumoral region where retinoids induce arginase-1 expression in CX3CR1+Ly6C+ macrophages, subsequently depriving CD8+ T cells of arginine and promoting HCC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDevelopment and validation of pFIB scores for exclusion of significant liver fibrosis in pediatric MASLD.\r\nAnalyzing several cohorts totaling approximately 1100 children and adolescents, we developed novel risk scores incorporating readily available clinical variables. In accordance with the aim of excluding pediatric MASLD-associated fibrosis, the scores performed better in non-selected cohorts of children and adolescents living with obesity than in patients referred to tertiary liver units.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDrug interaction with Udp-Glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes is a predictor of drug-induced liver injury.\r\nNotably, drug interactions with UGT enzymes may independently predict DILI, and their combined use with the rule-of-two model further improves overall predictive performance. These findings could expand the currently available tools for assessing the potential for DILI in humans.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndothelial RUNX3 controls LSEC dysfunction and angiocrine LRG1 signaling to prevent liver fibrosis.\r\nRUNX3 deficiency in the endothelium induces LSEC dysfunction, LRG1 secretion, and liver fibrosis progression. Therefore, endothelial RUNX3 is a crucial gatekeeping factor in LSECs, and profibrotic angiocrine LRG1 may be a novel target for combating liver fibrosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEpigenetic heterogeneity hotspots in human liver disease progression.\r\n Substantial epigenetic heterogeneity arises early in liver disease development, targeting key pathways in the progression and initiation of both cirrhosis and HCC. Integration of epigenetic and transcriptional heterogeneity unveils putative epigenetic regulators of hepatocarcinogenesis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nExome-wide association analysis identifies novel risk loci for alcohol-associated hepatitis. \r\nPolygenic signals for AH were observed in both common and rare variant analysis and identified genes with roles associated with inflammation. This study has identified two new genes of high effect size with a previously unknown contribution to ALD, and highlights both the overlap in etiology between liver diseases, and the unique origins of AH.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatic decompensation is the major driver of mortality in hepatocellular carcinoma patients treated with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab: The impact of successful antiviral treatment.\r\nHepatic decompensation identifies patients with the worst prognosis following AB and is more common in patients with baseline ALBI>1 and non-viral aetiology. Effective antiviral treatment may protect from decompensation, highlighting the prognostic disadvantage of patients with non-viral aetiologies and the importance of multi-disciplinary management to maximise OS.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver stiffness progression in biopsy-proven metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic disease among people with diabetes versus people without diabetes: A prospective multicenter study.\r\n Utilizing serial VCTE data from a multicenter study of participants with biopsy-proven MASLD, we demonstrate that T2DM and HbA1c are associated with LSM progression.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLiver transplantation provides survival benefit at all levels of frailty: From the Multicenter Functional Assessment in Liver Transplantation Study.\r\n Pre-LT and, to a lesser degree, post-LT mortality increased as LFI increased. Transplant offered a survival benefit at al LFI values, driven by a reduction in pre-LT mortality. No threshold of LFI was identified at which the risk of post-LT mortality exceeded pre-LT mortality. LT offers net survival benefit even in the presence of advanced frailty among those selected for LT.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPGD2/DP1 axis promotes liver regeneration by secreting Wnt2 in Kupffer cells in mice.\r\nDP1 activation mediates crosstalk between KCs and hepatocytes through Wnt2, and facilitates liver regeneration.

However, in patients with hepatorenal syndrome, AH was an independent predictor of mortality.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe effect of vitamin E and docosahexaenoic acid ethyl ester on Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD)-A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial (PUVENAFLD).\r\nThe combination of DHA + vitamin E or either agent alone did not demonstrate efficacy on reducing liver fat or aminotransferases in the studied population.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAm J Gastroenterol\r\n    Association of Acetaminophen (Paracetamol) Use with Severity and Outcomes in Patients with Viral Hepatitis-Associated Acute Liver Failure.\r\nAPAP use in AVH-ALF is common and may negatively impact outcomes compared to little or no APAP exposure. Prospective studies of the most safe and effective dose of APAP to use in patients with AVH are needed.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nComparative risk of serious infection with vedolizumab vs anti-TNF in inflammatory bowel disease: results from nationwide Swedish registers.\r\nVedolizumab was associated with increased risks of serious infections compared to anti-TNF in Crohn's disease, but not in ulcerative colitis. Nonetheless, the panorama of serious infections seemed to differ between the drugs. Our findings underscore the importance of clinical awareness of infections and the safety profile of the two therapies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGLP1-RA use prior to endoscopy is associated with low retained gastric contents: a multicenter cross-sectional analysis.\r\n In this multicenter study, very low rates of retained gastric contents were seen during endoscopy in patients on GLP1-RAs and most were in patients with T2DM. Our findings suggest an individualized approach rather than universal pre-operative holding of medications prior to endoscopy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHIV infection is associated with a less aggressive phenotype of inflammatory bowel disease. A multicenter study of the ENEIDA registry.\r\nHIV infection appears to be associated with a less aggressive phenotype of IBD and a lesser use of non-biological therapies and biologicals but entails a greater risk of developing OI.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHealthcare Resource Utilization and Costs Associated With Eosinophilic Esophagitis Among Commercially Insured Patients in the United States.\r\n EoE imposes substantial economic burden. More effective and targeted treatments that improve outcomes for patients are needed.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHistologic Activity from Neoterminal Ileal Biopsies in Patients with Crohn's Disease in Endoscopic Remission is Associated with Postoperative Recurrence.\r\nIn patients with postoperative CD, histologic activity despite complete endoscopic remission is associated with composite, endoscopic and radiographic, recurrence. Further understanding of the role of histologic activity in patients with Rutgeerts' i0 disease may provide a novel target to reduce disease recurrence in this population.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImpact of Bowel Preparation Quality on Colonoscopy Findings and Colorectal Cancer Deaths in a Nation-Wide Colorectal Cancer Screening Program.\r\n Fair bowel preparation on the Aronchick Scale was not only associated with a lower adenoma detection probability but also with increased risk of PCCRC death. Efforts should be made to increase bowel cleansing above fair scores.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImpact of Diabetes, Drug-Induced Liver Injury, and Sepsis on Outcomes in MAFLD-Related Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure.\r\n Almost half of MAFLD-ACLF patients die within 90 days. Diabetes and non-viral precipitants such as DILI and sepsis lead to adverse outcomes. The new MAFLD-MELD-Na and MAFLD-AARC scores provide reliable 90-day mortality predictions for MAFLD-ACLF patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOlder Age as a Worrisome Feature in Patients With Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms: a Long-Term Surveillance Study.\r\n Older patients with IPMNs were at a higher risk of developing pancreatic carcinoma during surveillance. Surgically fit elderly patients may be good candidates for periodic surveillance aimed at a reduction of pancreatic cancer-related deaths.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPsychiatric disorders among 5800 patients with microscopic colitis: A nationwide population-based matched cohort study.\r\n Patients with MC are at increased risk of incident psychiatric disorders compared to the general population.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Liver Cirrhosis Network Cohort Study: Cirrhosis Definition, Study Population, and Endpoints.\r\n The LCN Cohort Study design will inform the natural history of cirrhosis in contemporary patients with compensated cirrhosis. The LCN Definitions and Measures Committee developed criteria for the definition of cirrhosis to standardize entry into this multi-center cohort study and standardized criteria for liver-related outcome measures. This effort has produced definitions intended to be both sensitive and specific as well as easily operationalized by study staff such that outcomes critical to the LCN cohort are identified and reported in an accurate and generalizable fashion.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Survival Benefit of Re-abstinence After Harmful Alcohol Use Following Early Liver Transplant for Severe Alcohol-Associated Hepatitis: A Multi-Center ACCELERATE Study.\r\nAchieving re-abstinence after post-LT harmful alcohol use is associated with similar five-year post-LT survival compared to those without evidence of post-LT harmful alcohol use. Our findings highlight the importance of early detection and treatment of post-LT alcohol use.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nWhen Perfect Is the Enemy of Good: Results of a RAND Appropriateness Panel on Treat to Target in Asymptomatic IBD.\r\n Appropriateness ratings can help guide clinical decision-making about changing therapy to achieve endoscopic remission in asymptomatic patients with IBD until data from ongoing randomized studies are available.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Drug-Induced Liver Injury in Latin America: 10-year experience of the Latin American DILI (LATINDILI) Network Drug-induced liver injury in Latin America.\r\n Features of DILI in Latin America are comparable to other prospective registries. However, the pattern of drugs responsible for DILI differs. An increasing incidence of HDS, with high mortality rate, and likewise nimesulide and nitrofurantoin was noted. Thus, public health policies should raise awareness of the potential adverse effects of these compounds.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDynamics of liver stiffness measurement and clinical course of primary biliary cholangitis.\r\nTracking longitudinal changes in LSM using VCTE provides valuable insights into PBC prognosis, offering a robust predictive measure for the risk of SCE. LSM could be used as a clinically relevant surrogate endpoint in PBC clinical trials.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopy\r\n    Prospective feasibility study of a novel rigidizing stabilizing overtube in the resection of complex gastrointestinal polyps.\r\n The novel ROT was safe, with high technical and clinical success during resection of complex colon polyps. Future studies will determine timing of implementation during routine endoscopic resection.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Gut Pathobiont-Derived Outer Membrane Vesicles Drive Liver Inflammation and Fibrosis in PSC-IBD.\r\n This study demonstrates the contribution of gut pathobionts in releasing OMVs that traverse the mucosal barrier, and thus, promote liver inflammation and fibrosis in PSC-IBD. OMVs might represent a critical new environmental factor that interacts with other disease factors to cause inflammation and thus define potential new targets for fibrosis therapy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMolecular Mechanisms Underlying Loss of Vascular and Epithelial Integrity in Irritable Bowel Syndrome.\r\n Epithelial and vascular barriers are compromised in IBS patients and contribute to clinical manifestations.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe global incident gastrointestinal cancers attributable to suboptimal diets from 1990 to 2018.\r\nAlthough the proportional attributable GI incidence remains relatively stable, the doubling of absolute cases from 1990 to 2018, along with the discrepancies among urbanicity and countries/regions, informs dietary priorities and more targeted preventive measures.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    An integrated analysis of bile acid metabolism in humans with severe obesity.\r\nCharacterization of the portal BA composition in relation to peripheral and fecal BA increased insight into the dynamics of BA metabolism in individuals with obesity. Peripheral BA composition was much more diverse due to microbial metabolism. About 24% of the portal samples was surprisingly low in total BA;  the underlying mechanism requires further exploration.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Effect of pemvidutide, a GLP-1/glucagon dual receptor agonist, on MASLD: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.\r\nIn subjects with MASLD, weekly pemvidutide treatment yielded significant reductions in LFC, markers of hepatic inflammation, and body weight compared to placebo. Impact and implications MASLD, and MASH, are strongly associated with overweight and obesity and it is believed that the excess liver fat associated with obesity is an important driver of these diseases. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists elicit weight loss through centrally and peripherally mediated effects on appetite. Unlike GLP-1R agonists, glucagon receptor (GCGR) agonists act directly on the liver to stimulate fatty acid oxidation and inhibit lipogenesis, potentially providing a more potent mechanism for liver fat content (LFC) reduction than weight loss alone. This study demonstrated the ability of once-weekly treatment with pemvidutide, a dual GLP-1R/GCGR agonist, to significantly reduce LFC, hepatic inflammatory activity, and body weight, suggesting that pemvidutide may be an effective treatment for both MASH and obesity. Clinical trial number NCT05006885.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInfection history imprints prolonged changes to the epigenome, transcriptome and function of Kupffer cells.\r\n Our study demonstrates that a prior exposure to a parasitic infection induces trained immunity in KCs, reshaping their identity and function in the long-term. Impact and implications Although the liver is frequently affected during infections, and despite housing a major population of resident macrophages known as Kupffer cells (KCs), it is currently unclear whether infections can durably alter KCs and their niche cells. Our study provides a comprehensive investigation into the long-term impact of a prior, cured parasitic infection, unveiling long-lasting ontogenic, epigenetic, transcriptomic and functional changes to KCs as well as KC niche cells, which may contribute to KC remodeling. Our data suggest that infection history may continuously reprogram KCs throughout life with potential implications for subsequent disease susceptibility in the liver, influencing preventive and therapeutic approaches.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPatient-reported outcomes in chronic hepatitis delta: An exploratory analysis of the Phase III MYR301 trial of bulevirtide.\r\n PROs indicate that 48-week treatment with bulevirtide monotherapy may improve aspects of HRQoL in patients with CHD. Impact and implications Bulevirtide 2 mg is the only approved treatment for patients with chronic hepatitis delta (CHD) in the EU. Patients with CHD have worse quality of life scores than those with chronic hepatitis B. Bulevirtide treatment for 48 weeks reduced HDV RNA and alanine aminotransferase levels and was well tolerated among patients with CHD. For the first time, this study shows that patients who received bulevirtide therapy for 48 weeks reported improvements in physical and hepatitis-related quality of life domains compared to those who did not receive therapy (control group). Clinical trial registration\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nVaried immune responses of HBV-specific B cells in patients undergoing pegylated interferon-alpha treatment for chronic hepatitis B.\r\nAfter PEG-IFNα treatment, HBsAg- and HBcAg-specific B-cells exhibit various changes in antibody secretion. Their functional differences are reflected in the alterations in phenotypes and subtypes. The presence of CD40L + Tfh-cells is associated with the active recovery of HBsAg-specific B-cells. Impact and implications HBV-related complications and hepatocellular carcinoma remain the leading causes of mortality from chronic liver disease worldwide, and a cure is rarely achieved with antiviral therapies. Elucidating the immunological mechanisms underlying the functional cure of CHB patients offers a promising therapeutic strategy for viral clearance, such as therapeutic vaccine. We analyzed the alterations in HBV-specific B-cells in patients treated with PEG-IFNα and identified novel pathways for immunotherapeutic boosting of B cell immunity.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Editorial: Trajectory of soluble programmed cell death protein-1 and ligand-1 in HBV-infected individuals treated with pegylated interferon-implications for stopping rules and the HBV cure programme.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Diet and Microbiome-directed therapy 2.0 for IBD.\r\nWe also review the use of diet as a therapeutic tool in IBD, including the effects in induction and maintenance, special diets, and exclusive enteral nutrition. Finally, we highlight the challenges and opportunities for the translation of diet and microbiome interventions into clinical practice, such as the need for personalization, manufacturing and regulatory hurdles, and the specificity to take into account for clinical trial design.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHow Artificial Intelligence Will Transform Clinical Care, Research, and Trials for Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\nAs a complex disease with entangled relationships between genomics, metabolomics, microbiome, and the environment, IBD stands to benefit greatly from methodologies that can handle this complexity.
