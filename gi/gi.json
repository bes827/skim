Results/conclusion This expert commentary incorporates essential studies in this field and reflects the authors' expertise in the endoscopic evaluation of inflammatory bowel disease.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopy\r\n    Diversity, equity, and inclusion in gastrointestinal endoscopy: European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Position Statement.\r\n11: ESGE identifies mentorship and sponsorship as factors that may mitigate the barriers to academic careers for underrepresented endoscopy scholars. 12: ESGE recognizes the need to increase awareness of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in the field of endoscopy and supports publications on these topics.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeta-analysis\r\nmeta-analyses and systematic reviews\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Meta-analysis: Risk of lymphoma in patients with inflammatory bowel disease in population-based cohort studies.\r\nThe risk of lymphoma is only modestly increased in patients with IBD, with Crohn's disease having a slightly higher risk than ulcerative colitis. In IBD, there appears to be no difference between the risks of Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAm J Gastroenterol\r\n    Comparative efficacy and safety of Potassium-Competitive Acid Blocker (P-CAB) based dual, triple and quadruple regimens for first line H. pylori infection treatment: A systematic review and network meta-analysis.\r\nIn this NWM concerning the comparative efficacy and safety of P-CAB based dual, triple and quadruple regimens for first line H. pylori infection treatment, the overall results showed that PCAB based dual treatment ranked first for efficacy with the best-integrated efficacy-safety profile. This is of importance, since the dual regimens overcome the crucial issue of clarithromycin resistance. Consequently, these findings are expected to be useful in helping clinical decision-making and future guidelines.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nParticipation and Yield in Multiple Rounds of Colorectal Cancer Screening based on Fecal Immunochemical Test: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.\r\n In population-based CRC screening programs, the participation exhibited a slow upward trend for both screening strategies, but the incremental benefits in CRC detection gradually diminished. Tailored strategies, such as extending intervals for individuals with multiple negative FIT results, might optimize effectiveness and cost-efficiency in population-based CRC screening.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTEMPORAL TREND OF INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE OF EOSINOPHILIC ESOPHAGITIS IN ASIA: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS.\r\n The prevalence and incidence of EoE in Asia have been rising over the past decades. Due to the limited number of Asian studies and variations in subjects' sources, caution should be exercised when interpreting these results.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Interventions to Increase Follow-Up of Abnormal Stool-Based Colorectal Cancer Screening Tests in Safety Net Settings: A Systematic Review.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Interventions to Increase Follow-Up of Abnormal Stool-Based Colorectal Cancer Screening Tests in Safety Net Settings: A Systematic Review.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    A nationwide cohort study of inflammatory bowel disease, histological activity and fracture risk.\r\nHistological inflammation in IBD predicted a small increase in short-term fracture risk. Measures to reduce disease activity may reduce fracture risk in IBD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEight-year efficacy and safety of tenofovir alafenamide for treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infection: Final results from two randomised phase 3 trials.\r\n Long-term TAF treatment exhibited favourable safety and tolerability with high rates of viral suppression and no development of resistance.  numbers NCT01940341 and NCT01940471.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIdentification of four novel acute-on-chronic liver failure clusters with distinct clinical trajectories and mortality using machine learning methods.\r\nML for the first time could identify clusters with distinct phenotypes, trajectories and outcomes in ACLF. Stratification into clusters can address heterogeneity, guide prognosis, recruitment in trials, resource allocation and liver transplant discussions in ACLF.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImpact of non-selective beta blockers on further decompensation and death in decompensated cirrhosis: Benefit and risk stratification by MELD score.\r\n NSBBs may be beneficial for the prevention of further decompensation in cirrhotic patients with a MELD score of ≤9, but deleterious in those with a MELD score of >9.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIndividualized HCC surveillance using risk stratification scores in advanced fibrosis and cirrhotic HCV patients who achieved SVR: Prospective study.\r\n Individualized risk stratification using HCC risk scores was associated with improved early-stage detection and receipt of curative treatment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInsulin-like growth factor-1 in cirrhosis is linked to hepatic dysfunction and fibrogenesis and predicts liver-related mortality.\r\n Decreased levels of IGF-1 reflect impaired hepatic function and fibrogenesis in patients with cirrhosis, which seems particularly relevant in obesity since low IGF-1 was independently linked to high BMI. Lower IGF-1 in cirrhosis predicts decompensation, ACLF and liver-related death.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMetabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and MetALD increases the risk of liver cancer and gastrointestinal cancer: A nationwide cohort study.\r\nThis study showed that MASLD and MetALD are associated with an increased risk of cancer, particularly liver and gastrointestinal cancers. The findings build new evidence for the clinical outcomes of MetALD while highlighting the importance of managing alcohol intake properly in MASLD and MetALD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe association between alcohol consumption and cardiometabolic factors and liver fibrosis in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and metabolic dysfunction and alcohol-associated liver disease.\r\nAlthough both metabolic steatotic liver disease and metabolic alcohol-associated liver disease were correlated with liver fibrosis progression in both sexes, the impact of alcohol consumption and cardiometabolic factors on fibrosis progression differed by sex. Cardiometabolic factors may have a stronger impact on liver fibrosis than alcohol consumption in males with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTime to use the right classification to predict the severity of checkpoint inhibitor-induced liver injury, as assessed for causality using the updated RUCAM.\r\nThis retrospective study challenges the efficacy of the CTCAE classification in defining the severity of Checkpoint Inhibitor-induced hepatitis and suggests that the traditional hepatology-focused scores may be more relevant. The CTCAE classification is inconsistent and gives equal weight to jaundice and elevated transaminases, which leads to steroid overtreatment and limits the rechallenge of ICIs.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAm J Gastroenterol\r\n    A new drying method of thermolabile flexible endoscope channels by laminar and turbulent airflow - a prospective, randomized-controlled, single-center, proof-of-concept trial.\r\nDrying with a special automatic drying device was superior compared with an EWD's drying program as evidenced by no measurable residual water, reduced microbiological contamination and a more than two-fold decrease in operational time. Thus, drying by laminar and turbulent airflow may represent an attractive alternative to the currently used standard approach in the reprocessing process of flexible endoscopes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAnti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy and the Risk of Gestational Diabetes in Pregnant Women with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\n This nationwide cohort reported a decreased risk of GDM among patients who used anti-TNFs during early pregnancy compared to those unexposed. GDM risk may become a consideration in the decision-making process when choosing treatment options for pregnant women with a risk factor for GDM.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCOLORECTAL NEUROENDOCRINE NEOPLASM DETECTION RATE DURING COLONOSCOPY: RESULTS FROM LARGE-SCALE DATA OF COLONOSCOPIES IN JAPAN.\r\n The detection rate of colorectal NENs during colonoscopy is substantially higher than expected.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEvaluating Equity in Clinical Trial Accessibility: An Analysis of Demographic, Socioeconomic, and Educational Disparities in IBS Drug Trials.\r\n The findings highlight significant disparities in IBS trial participation across race, ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic backgrounds. This raises potential concerns about generalizability of trial outcomes and underscores the need for strategies to enhance inclusivity in clinical research.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGlobal Epidemiology of Cirrhosis in Women.\r\nSex differences in epidemiology are likely multifactorial, influenced by varying risk factors, susceptibility and behaviors between sexes. Further research is necessary to better understand these disparities and to tailor sex-specific interventions towards improved management and treatment strategies, ultimately enhancing outcomes for women with cirrhosis and providing better patient-centered care.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHealth state utility is substantially reduced with an increasing burden of patient-reported symptoms in eosinophilic esophagitis.\r\n EoE is associated with reduced health state utility, with symptoms most strongly predicting valuation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nResults from a psychometric validation study: irritable bowel syndrome patients report higher symptom burden using end-of-day versus real-time assessment.\r\nPsychometric evaluation demonstrated strong validity and reliability of the ESM-PROM for real-time GI symptom assessment in IBS. In addition, the ESM-PROM provides a precise and reliable ascertainment of individual symptom pattern and trigger interactions, without the bias of peak reporting when compared to retrospective methods. This highlights its potential as a valuable tool for personalized healthcare in monitoring disease course and treatment response in IBS patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Role of Diet in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Onset, Disease Management, and Surgical Optimization.\r\nFurther research is needed to fully elucidate how, when, and in whom diet therapies may be best applied to improve clinical and disease outcomes. The aim of this review is to summarize current research findings and serve as a tool to help facilitate patient-clinician conversations.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nWorldwide Prevalence and Description of Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome According to the Results of the Rome Foundation Global Epidemiology Study.\r\nCVS is a relatively common disorder that has a negative impact on quality of life. It is important to raise awareness on this syndrome to avoid underdiagnosis and improve clinical practice.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Efficacy and Safety of Upadacitinib for Perianal Fistulizing Crohn's Disease: A Post Hoc Analysis of 3 Phase 3 Trials.\r\n Patients with fistulizing disease (primarily perianal) treated with upadacitinib achieved higher rates of resolution of drainage, closure of external openings, clinical remission, and endoscopic response vs placebo.  numbers  U-EXCEL (NCT03345849), U-EXCEED (NCT03345836), U-ENDURE (NCT03345823).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRisk of recurrence in screen-versus non screen-detected colorectal cancer patients.\r\n Disease-free survival was significantly better in screen-detected compared to non-screen-detected CRCs independent of age, gender, tumor location, stage and treatment, and was associated with an overall survival benefit.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopy\r\n    Complete closure after colorectal endoscopic submucosal dissection with a re-openable clip with a sharp claw.\r\n Fast and complete closure after colorectal ESD was successfully achieved using MCD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nExploring the incidence of dysplasia or adenocarcinoma in early onset Barrett's esophagus.\r\nIn this 25-year period, 231 patients were diagnosed with early onset BE in the Netherlands, with 17 patients progressing to dysplasia and three developing adenocarcinoma. This corresponded to incidence rates of 7.3 per 1000 person-years for dysplasia and 1.3 per 1000 person-years for adenocarcinoma.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIntra- and Post-procedural Patient-reported Experience Measures and their Correlation with post-ERCP Adverse Events and Unplanned Healthcare Utilization.\r\nPatient-reported symptom scores from a simple Likert-based PREM at the time of discharge from ERCP are associated with presentations for pancreatitis, perforation, and UHU within 30 days. Applying PREMs post-ERCP could potentially prevent UHU and/or facilitate earlier management and improved outcomes for patients with post-ERCP AEs.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRandomized controlled trial of artificial intelligence diagnostic system in clinical practice to detect esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.\r\nThis study could not demonstrate an improvement in the esophageal cancer detection rate using the AI diagnostic support system for ESCC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Gastroscopy RAte of Cleanliness Evaluation (GRACE) Scale: an international reliability and validation study.\r\nthe GRACE scale showed good interobserver agreement and reliability and good validity. The spread of this scale could enhance the quality and standardize the cleanliness of the mucosa assessment during UGI endoscopy, pushing endoscopists to obtain excellent visibility and reducing the risk of missing lesions.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Detection of Gastrointestinal Bleeding with Large Language Models to Aid Quality Improvement and Appropriate Reimbursement.\r\n An LLM-based pipeline can robustly detect overt GIB in the EHR with clinically relevant applications in detection of recurrent bleeding and appropriate reimbursement coding.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMyosin Vb Traffics P-glycoprotein to the Apical Membrane of Intestinal Epithelial Cells.\r\nCollectively, these data demonstrate that Myo5b is necessary for the apical delivery of P-glycoprotein.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nObesity facilitated colon cancer progression is mediated by increased diacylglycerol o-acyltransferases 1 and 2 (DGAT½) levels.\r\n This is a novel mechanism of DGAT½-dependent metabolic and tumorigenic remodeling in obesity-facilitated colon cancer, providing a platform for the future development of effective treatments for colon cancer patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    Automatic Endoscopic Gastroplasty For The Treatment of Obesity: Results from A Prospective Multicenter Study.\r\n Our first-in-human study showed that the Endozip TM device is safe and effective in treating obesity. The weight loss led to comorbid changes and improvement in quality of life (, NCT04773795).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLONG-TERM CLINICAL EVALUATION OF A DECADE WITH PERORAL ENDOSCOPIC MYOTOMY AT A SINGLE EUROPEAN TERTIARY CENTER.\r\nTreatment success of POEM declines over time but remains sufficiently high in long-term perspective. Experience with the procedure improves the outcome. Gastroesophageal reflux affects almost half of patients early after POEM and decreases substantially over time together with rise in PPI-use.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nOptimal visual gaze pattern of endoscopists for improving adenoma detection during colonoscopy.\r\nColorectal adenoma detection was improved by correcting the endoscopist's gaze to the periphery of the screen, especially by dividing the screen into 6×6 segments.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Effect of Novel AI-based Cecum Recognition System on Adenoma Detection Metrics at Screening Colonoscopy Setting.\r\nImplementation of a post hoc verification of cecal intubation using an AI-CRS significantly improved various adenoma metrics in screening colonoscopy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe application of endoscopic purse-string suture in refractory non-variceal gastrointestinal bleeding:a multicenter study (with video).\r\n The endoscopic PSS is effective in treating refractory non-variceal gastrointestinal bleeding.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    Exchangeable copper for patients with Wilson disease at follow-up: rethinking normal ranges or changing methodology.\r\nOur findings suggest that CuEX is a suboptimal tool for assessing copper homeostasis when used alone and should be used with caution if no additional information is available. Normal reference intervals for WD-treated patients should be redefined, as most of CuEX quantifications fell in the lower range, with no sign of overtreatment in these patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFinite nucleos(t)ide-analogue therapy for functional cure in HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B: recent development in the paradigm shift.\r\nRecently, a large study in patients with HBV cirrhosis showed not only higher 10-year HBsAg loss rate (15.3 vs 1.6%) but also ~50% lower 10-year hepatocellular carcinoma incidence (16.5 vs 29.5%) and 60% lower liver-related mortality/transplantation rate (6.1 vs 15.1%) after Nuc cessation, as compared with well-matched patients continuing Nuc therapy. Since novel drug development aiming for functional cure has not been satisfactory, the strategy of finite Nuc therapy in HBeAg-negative CHB seems to be the best realistic option for functional cure today.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHarnessing ZIKV NS2A RNA for alleviating acute hepatitis and cytokine release storm by targeting translation machinery.\r\nZIKV NS2A dampens the production of proinflammatory cytokines and alleviates inflammatory injuries by interfering translation process as RNA molecules, which suggests that NS2A RNA is potentially used to treat numerous acute inflammatory diseases characterized by CRS.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTIPE2 protein restrains invariant NKT activation and protects against immune-mediated hepatitis in mice.\r\n Our findings reveal a new role of TIPE2 in the attenuation of iNKT cell-mediated hepatic injury. We propose that TIPE2 serves as an important regulator of immune homeostasis in the liver, and might be exploited for the therapeutic treatment of autoimmune liver diseases.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe actin-binding protein drebrin disrupts NF2-LATS kinases complex assembly to facilitate liver tumorigenesis.\r\nOur study identifies a novel DBN1-NF2-LATS axis, and pharmacological inhibition of DBN1 represents a promising alternative intervention targeting the Hippo pathway in cancer treatment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nViral antibody response predicts morbidity and mortality in alcohol-associated hepatitis.\r\nAbstinence from alcohol is associated with a significant increase in serum viral and bacterial antibody response. Decreased serum antiviral antibody repertoire is predictive of decompensation of liver disease and mortality in patients with AH.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    AI-Safe-C Score: Assessing Liver-Related Event Risks in Non-Cirrhotic Patients after Successful Direct-Acting Antiviral Treatment.\r\n AI-Safe-C score is a useful tool for identifying patients without cirrhosis who are at higher risk of developing LREs. The post-SVR LSM, as integrated within the AI-Safe-C score, plays a critical role in predicting future LREs. Impact and implications The AI-Safe-C score introduces a paradigm shift in the management of non-cirrhotic patients post-DAA treatment, a cohort traditionally not included in routine surveillance protocols for LREs. By accurately identifying a subgroup at a comparably high risk of LREs, akin to those with advanced fibrosis, this predictive model facilitates a strategic reallocation of surveillance and clinical resources.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDecreases in cT1 and liver fat content reflect treatment-induced histological improvements in MASH.\r\nThese results, from three combined drug trials, demonstrate that changes in multiparametric MRI markers of liver health (cT1 and PDFF) can predict histological response for steatohepatitis following therapeutic intervention. Impact and implications There is great interest in identifying suitable biomarkers that can be used to replace liver biopsy, or to identify those patients who would benefit from one, in both the clinical management of MASH and in drug development. We investigated the utility of two MRI-derived non-invasive tests, iron corrected T1 mapping (cT1) and liver fat content from proton density fat fraction (PDFF), to predict histological improvement in patients who had undergone experimental treatment for MASH. Using data from 150 people who participated in one of three clinical trials, we observed that a reduction in cT1 by over 80 ms and a relative reduction in PDFF of over 58% were the optimal thresholds for change that predicted resolution of steatohepatitis. PDFF as a marker of liver fat, and cT1 as a specific measure of liver disease activity, are both effective at identifying those who are likely responding to drug interventions and experiencing improvements in overall liver health. Clinical trial number(s) NCT02443116, NCT03976401, NCT03551522.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nExploring algorithms to select candidates for non-selective beta-blockers in cirrhosis: a post-hoc analysis of the PREDESCI trial.\r\nAlgorithms based only on LSM and platelet count are suboptimal to identify NSBB treatment candidates. Performing endoscopy in patients with indeterminate findings from NITs improved diagnostic performance and risk stratification. Endoscopy may be substituted by spleen stiffness for stratifying the risk in the grey zone. Impact and implications The PREDESCI trial demonstrated that non-selective beta-blockers prevent decompensation in CSPH patients. Still it is unclear whether we can select treatment candidates using non-invasive tests to assess the presence of CSPH without measuring HVPG. In the prospective cohort of patients screened during the trial, we showed that algorithms based on liver stiffness and platelet count had suboptimal performance, mainly due to a high rate of indeterminate results. Performing endoscopy in the grey zone patients allowed to significantly increase the number of patients with CSPH and improved the risk stratification for decompensation or death on long-term follow-up. These findings were validated in an independent cohort. In addition, a model using spleen stiffness instead of endoscopy showed similar diagnostic performance in the external validation cohort, suggesting that adequate risk stratification to select treatment candidates can be achieved with a fully non-invasive algorithm.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatocyte Aquaporin 8-mediated Water Transport Facilitates Bile Dilution and Prevents Gallstone Formation in Mice.\r\nAQP8 plays a crucial role in facilitating water transport and bile dilution during hepatic bile formation, thereby mitigating gallstone formation in mice. Small-molecule intervention validated hepatocyte AQP8 as a promising drug target for gallstone therapy. Impact and implications The incidence of gallstone disease is high, and current drug treatments for gallstones are very limited, necessitating the identification of novel drug targets for developing new drugs with universal applicability. To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide direct evidence that hepatic water channel AQP8 plays a key role in bile dilution and gallstone formation. Modulation of hepatic water transport may provide a universal therapeutic strategy for al types of gallstone diseases.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Editorial: Defining corticosteroid use in clinical trials.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReview article: Recommendations for detection, assessment and management of suspected drug-induced liver injury during clinical trials in oncology patients.\r\nThis review brings together evidence-based recommendations and expert opinion to provide the first dedicated consensus for best practices in detection, assessment, and management of DILI in oncology clinical trials.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Cold Snare Resection in the Colorectum: When to Choose it, When to Avoid it, and How to Do it.\r\nCold snare resection can be considered for certain lesions 11-19 mm in size and some lateral spreading lesions ≥ 20 mm. This review discusses tips and techniques to optimize cold snare resection.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCulturally-sensitive and Inclusive IBD Care.\r\nHeightening our patient care goals from cultural competence to cultural sensitivity allows healthcare professionals and the systems in which they practice to lead with cultural humility as they adopt a more inclusive and humble perspective when caring for patient groups with a diverse array of identities and cultures and to avoid maintaining the status quo of implicit and explicit biases that impede the delivery of quality IBD care. In this article, we will review the literature on IBD care in historically disadvantaged communities, address culturally-sensitive care, and propose a framework to incorporating cultural humility in IBD practices and research.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPersonalized (N-of-1) Clinical Trials for Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Opportunities and Challenges.\r\nThe N-of-1 trial design provides a patient-centered means of objectively determining individual response to therapy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopy\r\n    The battle to save the anus: a triumph of careful colonoscopy and medical history taking.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    What defines a healthy gut microbiome?\r\nThe review also highlights the resource-heavy nature of comprehensive gut health assessments, which hinders their practicality and broad application. Finally, we call for continued research and a nuanced approach to better understand the intricate and evolving concept of gut health, emphasising the need for more precise and inclusive definitions and methodologies in studying the microbiome.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Poor long-term outcome in patients with porto-sinusoidal vascular disease (PSVD: fact or disease

TC-325 results in improvements in immediate hemostasis, 30-day rebleeding and further bleeding, based on very low-to-low certainties of evidence.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    The association between obesity and malignant progression of Barrett's Esophagus: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis.\r\n Our meta-analysis provides some evidence that obesity as measured by BMI is associated with malignant progression of BE with a dose-response relationship. This finding requires confirmation in future high-quality cohort studies. Future risk prediction models could incorporate measures of obesity to potentially improve risk stratification in patients with BE.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    Efficacy of hemostatic powder monotherapy versus conventional endoscopic treatment for nonvariceal gastrointestinal bleeding: a meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis.\r\nIn conclusion, HP monotherapy surpassed CET in terms of the initial hemostasis rate and 30-day rebleeding rate for patients with malignancy-related GI bleeding. However, their relative efficacy for non-malignancy-related GI bleeding remains unresolved.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Differences in disease characteristics and treatment exposures between paediatric and adult-onset inflammatory bowel disease using a registry-based cohort.\r\nPaediatric-onset presents with more extensive disease with higher exposures to immunomodulators and biologic therapies than adult-onset IBD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGlycaemic control is a modifiable risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma and liver-related mortality in patients with diabetes.\r\nGlycaemic control is an independent risk factor for HCC and liver-related mortality, and should be incorporated into oncoprotective strategies in the general DM population.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLow socioeconomic status exacerbates unmet health-related needs in patients with autoimmune hepatitis.\r\n There is a high burden of health-related unmet needs in al patients with AIH that is exacerbated by low SES.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMASLD in people with HIV exhibits higher fibrosis stage despite lower disease activity than in matched controls.\r\n The NAS and histological drivers of fibrosis (e.g. inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning) are less pronounced in MASLD-PWH, and yet fibrosis stage was generally higher when compared to matched controls with MASLD without HIV. This suggests HIV-specific factors beyond hepatic necroinflammation may contribute to fibrosis progression in MASLD-PWH.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTrends of chronic liver diseases by income level and socioeconomic factors in the United States: A population-based study.\r\n LIG and MIG in the United States have higher liver disease burdens than HIG, with increasing NAFLD prevalence and lack of decline in current HCV infection prevalence over time as opposed to declining or stable trend in HIG.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAm J Gastroenterol\r\n    Management after obstetric anal sphincter injury: anorectal manometry and symptoms predict long-term fecal incontinence.\r\nSymptoms of anal incontinence and ARM in patients post OASI are both useful to predict subsequent long-term FI with a best-fit cut-off of 59mmHg for anal resting pressure. This provides rationale for routine ARM and accurate symptom assessment in al patients after OASI, to identify high risk groups to follow and treat, and it may assist decision-making regarding mode of subsequent obstetric deliveries.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPrevalence of Belching Disorders and Their Characteristics in the General Adult Population.\r\n A detailed epidemiology of belching disorders in adults was clarified.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPrimary liver cancer risk and mortality in patients with alcohol-related cirrhosis in England and Denmark: observational cohort studies.\r\n The risk of primary liver cancer was the same in English and Danish patients with ALD cirrhosis, and HCCs constituted 97% of primary liver cancers. Mortality with primary liver cancer was equally high in both countries. Notably, in England, where guidance recommends biannual HCC surveillance with ultrasound, patients with ALD cirrhosis were undergoing fewer than 1 ultrasound scan per year.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Impact of time period and birth cohort on the trend of advanced neoplasm prevalence in the 40-49 average-risk screening population.\r\n The prevalence of AN in age 40-54 increased in the Taiwanese population, with a later birth cohort having a higher prevalence of AN. However, the prevalence of AN in age 45-49 increased more remarkably and approximated that in age 50-54, which may justify earlier initiation of CRC screening at age 45.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndosc Int Open\r\n    Additional over-the-scope-clip closure can shorten endoscopic vacuum therapy for postoperative upper gastrointestinal leakage.\r\nThe addition of OTSCs after successful EVT is safe and has the potential to shorten leakage therapy, enabling earlier discharge along with better functional outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEfficacy and safety of radial incision and cutting for nonsurgical refractory benign esophageal stricture.\r\nRIC for nonsurgical refractory benign esophageal stricture is an effective and safe treatment option.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLymphovascular invasion is a dominant risk factor for lymph node metastasis in T2 rectal cancer. \r\nThis was a large study on LNM in T2 rectal cancer which showed that LVI is the dominant risk factor. Moreover, low age constituted an independent risk factor, whereas gender, resection margin, PNI, histologic grade, and mucinous cancer were not independent risk factors of LNM. Thus, these findings may provide a useful basis for management of patients after local resection of early rectal cancer.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPerformance evaluation of endoscopic ultrasonography needles: Experimental study.\r\nThe performance of the six needles differed in various ways. Understanding the characteristics of each needle may allow for selection of the appropriate needle for each situation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nUsefulness of an ultrathin endoscope in esophageal endoscopic submucosal dissection.\r\nUltrathin endoscopes may be useful for difficult esophageal ESD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nValidation and efficacy of the Varix Trainer model as a Training device for esophagogastroduodenoscopy. \r\nThe VTM1 distinguished varying levels of expertise for al techniques, suggesting that it is a valid tool for assessing endoscope manipulation skill. A short curriculum improved novices' manipulation skills faster than traditional practice.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopy\r\n    Prospective single-arm trial on feasibility and safety of endoscopic robotic system for colonic endoscopic submucosal dissection.\r\n This first clinical trial confirmed the safety and efficacy of performing colorectal ESD using EndoMaster EASE robotic system (Clinicaltrial.gov  NCT04196062).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Healthy first-degree relatives from multiplex families versus simplex families have a higher subclinical intestinal inflammation, a distinct fecal microbial signature, and harbor a higher risk of developing Crohn's disease.\r\n Within FDRs of patients with CD, participants from multiplex families had a 3-fold increased risk of CD onset, a higher FCP, and an altered bacterial composition, but not genetic burden or altered gut permeability. These results suggest that putative environmental factors might be enriched in FDRs from multiplex families.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nUNVEILING CANCER-RELATED METAPLASTIC CELLS IN BOTH HELICOBACTER PYLORI INFECTION AND AUTOIMMUNE GASTRITIS.\r\n Both Hp infection and AIG trigger a diverse array of metaplastic cell types. Identification of a cancer-related metaplastic cell uniquely expressing ANPEP/CD13, present in both Hp- and AIG-induced gastritis, indicates the carcinogenic capacity of both diseases. This discovery can guide early detection and risk stratification for patients with chronic gastritis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    Multimodal Convolutional Neural Network-Based Algorithm for Real-Time Detection and Differentiation of Malignant and Inflammatory Biliary Strictures in Cholangioscopy: a Proof of Concept Study with Video.\r\n Our algorithm distinguishes malignant and inflammatory bile duct lesions in dSOC videos, indicating the potential of CNN-based diagnostic support systems for both, CADe and CADx. The integration of non-image data can improve CNN based support systems, targeting current challenges in the assessment of biliary strictures.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nProphylactic endoscopic vacuum therapy for stricture prevention following wide-field endoscopic submucosal dissection of superficial esophageal cancer.\r\nThe prophylactic combination of EVT and BOT is a novel and promising strategy for reducing post-ESD strictures.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSafety and efficacy of underwater endoscopic mucosal resection for 10-20 mm colorectal serrated lesions (SEA CLEAR study).\r\nThis two-center prospective study demonstrated that UEMR for SLs sized 10-20 mm was comparable to previous conventional endoscopic mucosal resection outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    Epidemiology of gastrointestinal cancers: a systematic analysis from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.\r\nAlthough the ASIR of oesophageal, gastric and biliary tract cancer has decreased, the ASIR still increased in colorectal, pancreatic and liver cancer from steatotic liver disease. Public policies are important for controlling gastrointestinal cancers-most importantly, reducing alcohol consumption, hepatitis B immunisation and tackling the burden of metabolic diseases.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIdentification of PRMT5 as a therapeutic target in cholangiocarcinoma.\r\n PRMT5 and MEP50 are frequently upregulated in human CCA, and PRMT5-targeting drugs have significant antitumoural efficacy in clinically relevant CCA models. Our findings support the evaluation of PRMT5 inhibitors in clinical trials, including their combination with cytotoxic and immune therapies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLong-term hepatitis B surface antigen response after finite treatment of ARC-520 or JNJ-3989.\r\n Short-duration siRNA treatment suppressed HBsAg expression with a prolonged effect for up to 6 years in some participants.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMicrobiota-induced S100A11-RAGE axis underlies immune evasion in right-sided colon adenomas and is a therapeutic target to boost anti-PD1 efficacy.\r\n Our findings unravelled that dysfunctional goblet cells and consequential bacterial translocation activated the S100A11-RAGE axis in right-sided colon ADs, which recruits MDSCs to promote immune evasion. Targeting this axis by Azeliragon improves the efficacy of immunotherapy in colon cancer.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRisk of hepatic events associated with use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors versus glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, and thiazolidinediones among patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.\r\nIn this nationwide cohort study, SGLT-2i was associated with a lower risk of hepatic decompensation events in patients with MASLD compared with TZD, while demonstrating similar effectiveness to GLP-1RA.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSphincterotomy for biliary sphincter of Oddi disorder and idiopathic acute recurrent pancreatitis: the RESPOnD longitudinal cohort.\r\n Nearly 60% of patients undergoing ERCP for suspected SOD improve, although the contribution of a placebo response is unknown. Contrary to prevailing belief, duct size and labs are poor response predictors. AP recurrence was common and like observations from prior non-intervention cohorts, suggesting no benefit of sphincterotomy in mitigating future AP episodes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    Association of hepatitis delta virus infection and hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatic decompensation, all-cause and liver-related death in a national cohort.\r\n In a predominantly U.S born cohort of Veterans, HDV co-infection was associated with an increased risk of liver-related outcomes and all-cause mortality. Our findings support widespread testing for early identification of HDV.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCentral role for cholangiocyte pathobiology in cholestatic liver diseases.\r\nThe crosstalk between cholangiocytes and cells of the innate (neutrophils and macrophages), and adaptive (T-cells and B-cells) immune systems is also examined in detail. The information will help consolidate information on this topic, guide further research and potential therapeutic strategies for these diseases.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDisparity landscapes of viral-induced structural variations in hepatocellular carcinoma: Mechanistic characterization and functional implications. \r\nAdditionally, clonal disparity of HBV integration was observed among patients and the higher level of clonal disparity score can indicate poor patients' prognostication. Taken together, our study uncovered the different levels of clonal enrichment of HBV integration, mechanistic insights, and prognostic biomarker signature, to strengthen our understanding in HBV-associated hepatocarcinogenesis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEfficacy and safety of infliximab in patients with autoimmune hepatitis.\r\n Our study suggests that infliximab may be an effective and safe rescue therapy in AIH.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHAF prevents hepatocyte apoptosis and progression to MASH and hepatocellular carcinoma through transcriptional regulation of the NF-κB pathway.\r\nHAF is novel transcriptional regulator of the NF-κB pathway and is a key determinant of cell fate during progression to MASH and MASH-HCC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHEAR-MHE study: Automated speech analysis identifies minimal hepatic encephalopathy and may predict future overt hepatic encephalopathy.\r\nAutomated speech analysis highly correlated with validated HE tests, associated with MHE, and may predict future OHE. Future research is needed to validate this tool and to understand how it can be implemented in clinical practice.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHKDC1 promotes liver cancer stemness under hypoxia via stabilizing β-catenin.\r\nOverall, our findings underscore HKDC1 as a prometastatic HK specifically expressed in the malignant compartment of primary liver tumors, thereby providing a mechanistic basis for targeting this enzyme in advanced liver cancer.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHealth-Related quality of life (HRQL) assessments in a 52-Week, Double-Blind, randomized, Placebo-Controlled phase 3 study of resmetirom (MGL-3196) in patients with metabolic dysfunction associated steatohepatitis (MASH) and fibrosis.\r\nMASH/NASH patients with fibrosis improvement or resolution of MASH with resmetirom experienced clinically meaningful and statistically significant HRQL improvements.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPredictors of long-term clinical outcomes after TIPS: An ALTA group study.\r\nAmong patients with early post-TIPS TFS, prognosis and need for LT should be reassessed, informed by post-procedure changes in MELD-Na and clinical status. For selected patients, \"destination TIPS\" without LT may offer long-term survival with freedom from portal hypertensive complications.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nStretch-induced hepatic endothelial mechanocrine promotes hepatocyte proliferation.\r\nOur findings indicate that mechanical stretch-induced HB-EGF up-regulation in LSECs via YAP translocation can promote the hepatocyte proliferation during liver regeneration through a mechanocrine manner, which deepens the understanding of the mechanical-biological coupling in liver regeneration.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Assessment of liver graft quality during hypothermic oxygenated perfusion: the first international validation study.\r\nThis first international study validates the predictive value of the mitochondrial co-factor FMN, released from complex I during HOPE, and may therefore contribute to a better risk stratification of injured livers before implantation. Impact and implications Analysis of 473 perfusates, collected from 10 international centers during hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (HOPE), revealed that mitochondria derived flavin mononucleotide (FMN) values in perfusate is predictive for graft loss, cholangiopathy, and kidney failure after liver transplantation. This result is of high clinical relevance, as recognition of graft quality is urgently needed to improve the safe utilization of marginal livers. Ex-situ machine perfusion approaches, such as HOPE, are therefore likely to increase the number of useable liver grafts.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIntention-to-treat outcomes of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma receiving immunotherapy before liver transplant: the multicenter VITALITY study.\r\nThe first multicenter evaluation of HCC patients receiving ICI pre-LT demonstrates favorable survival and safety outcomes, justifying continued utilization and further evaluation of this strategy in clinical practice. High tumor burden, doubling of AFP levels, and radiographic response were identified as predictors of unfavorable oncologic outcomes. Impact and implications The first multicenter evaluation of pre-transplant immune-checkpoint-inhibitors in hepatocellular carcinoma to show promising intention-to-treat survival, safety and rejection rates. Immune-checkpoint-inhibitors, either alone or combined with LRT, demonstrate reliable efficacy. This preoperative strategy could be particularly beneficial for high-risk patients, including those requiring downstaging or with elevated AFP levels despite locoregional treatment. These findings fill current knowledge gaps and offer reassuring evidence for the feasibility of pre-transplant use of immune-checkpoint-inhibitors, pending results from ongoing trials.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNon-invasive assessment of severe liver fibrosis in patients with Fontan-associated liver disease: The VALDIG-EASL FONLIVER cohort.\r\n Severe liver fibrosis is prevalent in adults following Fontan-type palliation and can be effectively estimated using with the novel FonLiver risk score.

Impact and implications Excessive high-energy diet ingestion is critical in driving steatohepatitis via regulation of hepatocyte non-receptor tyrosine kinases. The mechanisms under lying the regulation of hepatocyte PYK2 in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) remain largely unclear. Here, we found that T6BP as a critical fatty liver eliminator has a significant impact on the development of promising therapeutic targets. Additionally, vital T6BP-based pharmacon fragments that impede PYK2 dimerization have been found, offering new and effective treatments for advanced fatty liver symptoms and complications.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Editorial: Emulsifiers and thickeners in our food-Do they alter gut permeability?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Intestinal permeability in disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI): From bench to bedside.\r\nAdditionally, the microbiome's significant role in the communication between the brain and gut has led to the integrative model of a microbiome gut brain axis with reciprocal interactions between brain networks and networks comprised of multiple cells in the gut, including immune cells, enterochromaffin cells, gut microbiota and the derived luminal mediators.

Gov identifier NCT01477957.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nFrailty and risk of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and other chronic liver diseases.\r\nFrailty was associated with an increased risk of chronic liver diseases. Public health strategies should target reducing chronic liver disease risk in frail individuals. Impact and implications While frailty is common and associated with a poor prognosis in people with MASLD and advanced chronic liver diseases, its impact on the subsequent risk of these outcomes remains largely unexplored. Our study showed that frailty was associated with the increased risks of MASLD, cirrhosis, liver cancer, and liver-related mortality. This finding suggests that assessing frailty may help identify a high-risk population vulnerable to developing chronic liver diseases. Implementing strategies that target frailty could have major public health benefits for liver-related disease prevention.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIdentification and functional validation of miR-190b-5p and miR-296-3p as novel therapeutic attenuators of liver fibrosis.\r\nCollectively, in our study we discovered miR-190b-5p and miR-296-3p as two novel anti-fibrotic miRNAs, and that HAS2 and ITGA6 contribute to miR-190b-5p- and miR-296-3p-mediated inhibition of liver fibrosis. These results provide a foundation for future research to explore the clinical utility of miR-190b-5p and miR-296-3p in liver injuries with fibrosis. Impact and implications Liver fibrosis and cirrhosis contribute to millions of deaths world-wide and, till date, remain as unmet medical needs. In this study, we discovered two microRNAs, miR-190b-5p and miR-296-3p, which suppress liver fibrosis in preclinical mouse models and a human liver bud model. Our promising results encourage further studies that aim to develop both miRNAs for the treatment of liver fibrosis in patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSequential Peg-IFN after bepirovirsen may reduce post-treatment relapse in chronic hepatitis B.\r\nSequential therapy with bepirovirsen followed by Peg-IFN is tolerable and effective in participants with chronic HBV infection on stable NA.
