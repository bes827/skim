The survival data of second-line cabozantinib following the first-line ICI regimen provide reference for clinical trial testing post-ICI therapy. The number of prior line of treatment may be considered a stratification factor in randomized study. Impact and implications There is a lack of prospective data on systemic therapy following prior immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The current phase II clinical trial reported the efficacy and safety data of cabozantinib in patients with prior ICI-based treatment. Exploratory analyses showed that the performance of cabozantinib differed significantly when used as second or third-line treatment. The above data could be used a reference for clinical practice and design of future clinical trials on subsequent treatment following ICIs.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nProminent role of gut dysbiosis in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis-related liver disease in mice.\r\n Defective CFTR in the gut sustains a pathogenic microbiota, creates an inflammatory milieu, and alters intestinal permeability. These changes are necessary for the development of cholangiopathy. Restoring CFTR in the intestine or modulating the microbiota could be a promising strategy to prevent or attenuate liver disease. Impact and implications Severe cystic fibrosis-related liver disease (CFLD) affects 10% of the patients and contributes to increased morbidity and mortality of CF patients. Treatment options remain limited due to a lack of understanding of the disease pathophysiology. The Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) mediates Cl - and HCO - secretion in the biliary epithelium and its defective function is thought to cause cholestasis and excessive inflammatory responses in CF. However, our study in CFTR-knockout mice demonstrates that microbial dysbiosis, combined with increased intestinal permeability caused by defective CFTR in the intestinal mucosa, acts as a necessary co-factor for the development of CFLD-like liver pathology in mice. These findings uncover a major role for the gut microbiota in CFLD pathogenesis and call for further investigation and clinical validation to develop targeted therapeutic strategies acting on the gut-liver axis in CF.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nProspective head-to-head comparison of non-invasive scores for diagnosis of fibrotic MASH in patients with type 2 diabetes.\r\n Our findings show that FAST, MAST, MEFIB and FNI are accurate non-invasive tools to identify T2DM patients with fibrotic MASH in secondary/tertiary diabetes clinics.

It can reasonably be proposed and pursued. The unexpected high risk of drop out in T1 patients seems related to the MELD-based driving rules underserving this subgroup, calling for revision of allocation rules. Impacts and implications To maximize utility and prevent premature liver transplantation (LT), a delayed LT strategy (DS) was adopted in France in 2015. It consists in postponing LT until recurrence in patients listed for any single HCC curatively treated by surgical resection or thermal ablation. The DELTA HCC study was conducted to evaluate this nationwide strategy. It shows in a non-US, European LT program that DS - does not negatively impact pre- nor post-LT patients 'outcome,- concerns up to 20% of LT candidates-has therefore the potential to redistribute organs to patients in more urgent need of LT. Such a delayed strategy can reasonably be pursued and extended to other LT programs. Of note, an unexpected high risk of drop out in T1 patients, seemingly related to MELD-based offering rules which underserve these patients, calls for further scrutinization and revision of allocation rules in this subgroup.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPost-treatment LSM rather than change during treatment predicts decompensation in patients with cACLD after HCV cure.\r\nFU-LSM is key for risk stratification after HCV-cure and should guide clinical decision-making.

Impact and implications The National Liver Offering Scheme (NLOS) was introduced in the UK in 2018 to increase transparency of the deceased donor liver offering process, maximise the overall survival of the waiting list population, and improve equity of access to liver transplantation. To our knowledge, it is the first scheme that offers organs based on statistical prediction of transplant benefit;  the Transplant Benefit Score (TBS). The results are important to the transplant community - from healthcare practitioners to patients - and demonstrate that, in the first two years of NLOS offering, waiting-list mortality fell while post-transplant survival was not negatively impacted, thus delivering on the scheme's objectives. The scheme continues to be monitored to ensure that the TBS remains up-to-date and that signals that suggest the possible disadvantage of some patients are investigated.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTreatment response and clinical event-free survival in autoimmune hepatitis: a Canadian multicentre cohort study.\r\n In people living with AIH, sustained elevated aminotransferase values, but not IgG, are associated with poorer long-term outcomes. Biochemical response and long-term survival are not associated with starting prednisone dose. Impact and implications Using clinical data from multiple Canadian liver clinics treating autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), we evaluate treatment response and clinical outcomes. For the first time, we apply mixed-effect and time-varying survival statistical methods to rigorously examine treatment response and the impact of fluctuating liver biochemistry on clinical event-free survival. Key to the study impact, our data is 'real-world', represents a diverse population across Canada, uses continuous measurements over follow-up, and our findings help inform risk stratification of patients. We provide evidence for treating clinicians, as well as those developing and evaluating new therapies, to seek evidence of good treatment response by keeping aminotransferase activity values within the reference range. Our results challenge the role of IgG as a marker of treatment response and if normalisation of IgG should remain an important part of the definition of biochemical remission. Our analysis further highlights that baseline markers of disease severity may not prognosticate early treatment response. Additionally, the initial prednisone dose may be less relevant for achieving aminotransferase normalisation. This is important for patients and treating clinicians given the relevance and importance of side-effects of treatment for patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Neurogastroenterol Motil\r\n    Consistency of Feces Affects Defecatory Function.\r\n Fecal consistency affects defecatory parameters.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Editorial: Muscles at the expense of liver injury.

Here we explore the impact of the EMA reflection paper on PBC therapy and offer pragmatic solutions for generating evidence of long-term outcomes through Real World data collection.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    FASN-mediated fatty acid biosynthesis remodels immune environment in Clonorchis sinensis infection-related intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.\r\nWe uncover the metabolic signature and immune microenvironment of C. sinensis-infected ICCs and highlight the combination of FASN inhibitors with immunotherapy as a promising strategy for treating C. sinensis-infected ICCs. Impact and implications C. sinensis-infected ICC patients have a poorer prognosis and worse response to immunotherapy than non-C. sinensis-infected ICCs. The underlying molecular characteristics of C. sinensis-infected ICCs remains unclear. Herein, we demonstrate that up-regulation of FASN and free fatty acids in C. sinensis-infected ICCs leads to immunosuppressive microenvironment formation and tumor progression. Thus, administration of FASN inhibitors could significantly reverse immunosuppressive environment and further enhance anti-PD-1 efficacy in combating C. sinensis-infected ICCs.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPhenotypes and ontogeny of senescent hepatic stellate cells in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.\r\nThese data define features of HSC senescence in human and murine MASLD, establishing an important blueprint to target these cells as part of future antifibrotic therapy.  \r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\r\npublisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Review article: New developments in biomarkers and clinical drug development in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency-related liver disease.\r\nThis inaugural forum generated a list of recommendations to address unmet needs in the field of AATLD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Targeting IL-1 in severe alcohol-related hepatitis: How many frogs will we need to kiss to find an effective therapy?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nUnraveling the liver antiviral immunity in functional cure of chronic hepatitis B using scRNASeq.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous\r\nmisc publications eg case reports, tools of the trade, images of\r\nthe month, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am J Gastroenterol\r\n    A Case of Dysphagia Megalatriensis.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nA superficial spreading type of early gastric cancer arising in autoimmune gastritis.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAn Unusual Case of Small Intestinal Hemorrhage.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nElectronic coding for abnormal fecal immunochemical test is associated with increased colonoscopy completion.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNavigating the Complex Landscape of Dietary Elimination Therapy in Eosinophilic Esophagitis: Can We Personalize It?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPharyngeal Anomaly -
