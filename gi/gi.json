The degree of BU improvement was similar among agents. Areas for future research include investigation of BU outcomes with other IBD therapies, exploration of underlying mechanisms of action, and greater standardisation for measuring BU through validated scores.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Systematic Review: Stigma Associated With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\n This highlights the heterogeneity in stigma assessment methods and the need for more standardised research. It also emphasises the importance of addressing stigma through increased awareness, support and interventions aimed at enhancing resilience and coping skills.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Waitlist and Post-Transplant Outcomes in Liver Transplantation for Alcohol-Associated Liver Disease: An Individual Patient Data Meta-Analysis.\n In this reconstructed individual patient data meta-analysis, waitlist survival was comparable between ALD and non-ALD patients. While early post-transplant patient survival was similar, long-term survival remained inferior in ALD, partly attributed to increased de novo malignancy. These findings highlight the need for improved candidate selection, addiction care, and cancer surveillance to maximise long-term outcomes in the growing ALD transplant population.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Endoscopy\n    Environmental footprint of gastrointestinal endoscopy services: a systematic review.\n - Current evidence on the environmental impact of GI endoscopy services is fragmented, methodologically inconsistent, and often limited in coverage. Emissions were dominated by patient travel, energy use and procedure-related products. Broader and more standardized environmental assessments are needed to guide the transition to low-carbon, sustainable GI endoscopy. .\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Hepatology\n    Technical systematic review supporting 2025 AASLD Practice Guidelines on management of chronic hepatitis B.\nDespite low certainty, the findings support shared decision-making in high-risk horizontal transmission scenarios or in treating individuals in the immune tolerance phase, caution in discontinuing antiviral therapy in virologically suppressed individuals without HBsAg loss, and tailored HCC surveillance for those with co-infection or cirrhosis.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \n\n\nOriginal articles\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\n\n\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\n    Indocyanine Green Clearance Correlates With Biomarkers Reflecting Key Disease-Driving Mechanisms in Advanced Chronic Liver Disease and Predicts Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure and Death.\nICG-R15 by PDD correlates with portal hypertension and systemic inflammation/circulatory dysfunction as key disease-driving mechanisms in ACLD. While showing insufficient discrimination for CSPH, ICG-R15 independently predicted ACLF/liver-related mortality in decompensated cirrhosis.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Very Early-Stage Detection Is Associated With Improved Survival in Patients With Unifocal Hepatocellular Carcinoma.\nDetection of HCC at a T1a stage conveys a survival advantage compared to T1b stage, underscoring a continued need for improvements in HCC surveillance efficacy.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Am J Gastroenterol\n    Use of Natural language processing to objectively identify hepatic encephalopathy in multiple cohorts.\nFive signs, symptoms, and treatment decisions with simple phrases extracted from inpatient charts using NLP define HE across three cohorts.

Targeting the KLF9-NR4A1 axis may offer a novel therapeutic approach for managing NAFLD in patients with OSA and other hypoxia-related disorders.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Satellite lesions versus intrahepatic metastasis in multifocal intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: Prognostic impact and genomic profiling.\nMultifocal ICC should be categorized as AJCC Stage III disease regardless of IM and SL patterns. Both SL and IM are clonal origin derived from primary ICC tumor, and represent metastatic progression with poor long-term survival.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx J Hepatol\n    Predicting hepatic decompensation using non-invasive tests in a contemporary multicentre cohort of patients with cACLD.\n In our multicentre study of contemporary European cACLD patients, non-invasively estimated CSPH risk was as predictive for decompensation as HVPG. Models comprising indicators of portal hypertension and albumin discriminated between patients at negligible decompensation risk and those with a 1-year risk of ≈15%, i.e., the potential target population for preventive strategies. Impact and implications Non-invasive tests (NITs) facilitate the early diagnosis and management of clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) in patients with compensated advanced chronic liver disease (cACLD) patients. In our contemporary cohort of cACLD patients with mainly steatotic liver disease recruited at 16 European expert centres, the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) and NITs were similarly predictive of decompensation within one to two years of follow-up. Serum albumin levels were identified as the second main predictor of decompensation besides the HVPG or NITs for CSPH. Novel models were developed that could accurately predict the risk for decompensation, thereby refining point-of-care risk stratification and clinical trial design in CTP-A cACLD patients.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Setd4-expressing cells drive regenerative recovery in chronic liver injury.\nAs a reserve population, dormant Setd4 + cells survive during chronic injury and then, beyond activation via chromatin remodelling, initiate de novo regeneration fundamental for recovery after chronic injury. Impact and implications  This study reports a longevity population of dormant Setd4 + cell in the murine liver midlobular zone 2 that survive under chronic injury and then activate for facilitating regenerative recovery. As a reserve population, Setd4 + cells initiate de novo regeneration representing fundamental for chronic injury recovery via chromatin accessibility remodelling. Impact and implication Jia et al report a longevity population of dormant Setd4 + cell in the murine liver midlobular zone 2 that survive under chronic injury and then activate for facilitating regenerative recovery.

Our findings suggest positioning NCGWS within the spectrum of disorders of gut-brain interaction once organic pathologies have been excluded.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx J Hepatol\n    Refining the Baveno VII criteria for clinically significant portal hypertension: an individual-patient data meta-analysis.\n Baveno VII criteria for CSPH adequately classify patients across etiologies, except MASLD with obesity. Using a ≥75% risk threshold by ANTICIPATE models to detect CSPH improves global performance, including MASLD with obesity, supporting it can be a simpler way of predicting CSPH in clinical practice. Impact and implications This systematic review and meta-analysis confirm the validity for ruling out and ruling in CSPH in cACLD patients with the Baveno VII criteria. Using a threshold of ≥75% of the ANTICIPATE±NASH models, the global performance for detecting CSPH improves regardless of etiology. This represents a very practical approach for general hepatologists to select patients for prophylactic β-blocker therapy as its calculation relies on BMI, liver stiffness and platelet count with an online calculator.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \n\n\nOriginal articles\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\n\n\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\n    High Risk of Colorectal Cancer After High-Grade Dysplasia in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients.\nThe risk of synchronous and metachronous CRC after a diagnosis of high-grade dysplasia underlines the high-risk profile of this subgroup of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The possible advantages of colon-sparing treatment should be balanced with the higher risk of metachronous CRC and the subsequent need for stringent endoscopic surveillance.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Inherited Genetic Risk of Liver Fibrosis in Lean Versus Nonlean Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD).\nThe prevalence of significant fibrosis and the effect of GRS were similar in lean and nonlean MASLD, highlighting that lean MASLD patients may have a comparable risk to overweight and obese MASLD.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Research Communication: Real-World Clinical Experience With Seladelpar in Primary Biliary Cholangitis.\nBiochemical response was achieved in 56.3% of patients and normalisation of alkaline phosphatase levels in 31.3% of patients after 1 month of treatment.

These results encourage additional efforts to consider MAiD as a valuable additional source of liver grafts. Further studies and larger clinical experience are necessary to validate these results. Impact and implications Liver transplantation with grafts following medical assistance in dying has satisfactory patients and graft survival rates, and the incidence of major post-operative events and complications were comparable with the standard circulatory death donors.Cumulatively, medical assistance in dying donors contributed to a significant increase of the donation after circulatory death liver transplantation activity in Canada by 21.8% in a 7-year period.This data encourages to pursue donation following medical assistance in dying as a valuable additional source of grafts, also allowing to fulfill patient's wishes to donate their organs and help others.\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \n\n\nReviews&Editorials\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the\npublisher website using the provided link\n\n\n    Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol\n    Blue Notes.\n\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Strategies to Promote Health Equity in Professional Society Clinical Guidance in Gastroenterology.\n\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx J Hepatol\n    BCLC strategy for prognosis prediction and treatment recommendations: The 2025 update.\nThese updates are particularly important for clinicians, tumor boards, and guideline developers, as well as for patients and caregivers who face complex choices in real-world practice.

These findings support refining surveillance guidelines and adaptation of risk stratification tools.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Research Communication: Teriflunomide Does Not Affect Gluten-Specific T-Cell Activity in Coeliac Disease-A Randomised, Placebo-Controlled Trial.\r\nThe main aim was to observe attenuation of gluten-specific T-cell activation markers after gluten exposure. We found no significant differences in T-cell activity between groups, concluding that teriflunomide is ineffective as a non-dietary treatment for coeliac disease.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Treatment-Free Outcomes Following Surgery for IBD: A Nationwide Cohort Study.\r\nSurgery obviated the need for future therapy in 22% of patients with CD and 42% with UC. Absence of extraintestinal manifestations, older age in UC, and longer disease duration and absence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in CD may highlight an opportunity for precision surgery to identify those most likely to achieve long-term benefit from surgical intervention.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Am J Gastroenterol\r\n    Comparative Safety of Advanced Therapies in Patients with Ulcerative Colitis: An Administrative Claims-based Study.\r\nIn a real-world cohort of patients with UC, anti-interleukins and JAK inhibitors were associated with lower risk of serious infections and may offer net benefit, especially in patients with prior TNF antagonist exposure.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Demodicosis Mimics Acneiform Eruptions in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease Receiving Upadacitinib: A Case Series.\r\nDemodicosis should be considered in patients with IBD having acneiform eruptions, particularly those receiving upadacitinib.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Effects of Screening Colonoscopy: Evidence From Observational and Interventional Studies.\r\nWe conclude that, despite apparent differences in reported results, both observational and interventional provide compelling evidence for strong preventive effects of screening colonoscopy. On the population level, similarly strong incidence and mortality reduction might be reached by well-organized screening programs achieving higher adherence rates with less invasive screening tests.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Impact of Artificial Intelligence Use on Endoscopist Optical Diagnosis of Sessile Serrated Lesions, Traditional Serrated Adenomas and Advanced Conventional Adenomas.\r\nCADx use did neither significantly harm nor improve optical diagnostic performance for SSLs despite CADx inability to classify SSLs.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Per-oral endoscopic myotomy-induced reduction of crural diaphragm contractility might contribute to development of post-procedural reflux esophagitis.\r\nPOEM can impair CD contraction, and weak CD contraction was associated with post-POEM RE.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx The Risk of Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\n While the risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy overall was not increased in pregnancies affected by IBD, there was an increased risk of preeclampsia. This may reflect underlying immune-mediated placental dysfunction.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx The impact of E-Cigarettes and Heat-Not-Burn Tobacco on Postoperative Recurrence of Crohn's Disease: A Multicenter International Study.\r\n HNBT, and possibly e-cigarettes, are associated with increased endoscopic recurrence of CD compared to non-smoking.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Utility of quantitative fecal immunochemical test values for average risk colorectal cancer screening risk stratification among patients with a positive test.\r\n Neoplastic findings occurred across the whole spectrum of qFIT values, emphasising the need for colonoscopy for al positive qFIT tests. However, increasing qFIT values correlated with the PPV for CRC and advanced adenoma and may help to stratify patients at highest risk for detecting serious neoplastic lesions in resource-constrained settings.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Recent Trends of Incidence, Mortality, Treatment, and Overall Survival of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in the United States.\r\n HCC incidence rates have started to decline, and incidence-based mortality has plateaued. Given lower early-stage detection and curative treatments during the COVID-19 pandemic, longer-term follow-up is warranted to assess the impact on survival. The reduced survival disparities between non-Hispanic Black and White patients may reflect improved equitable medical access.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Seroprevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection among asymptomatic patients served by a safety-net healthcare system.\r\n In this population-based study, almost two-thirds of asymptomatic patients were seropositive for H. pylori. Prevalence was over 40% among al sub-groups. Screening solely based on race and ethnicity may inadvertently exacerbate disparities by overlooking confounding factors for infection like low socioeconomic status and regional exposures.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Endoscopy\r\n    Individuals with polyps ≥10mm without other high-risk features have a similarly low post-colonoscopy colorectal cancer risk as those with no polyps.\r\nPCCRC-risk 5 years after baseline colonoscopy within individuals with polyps ≥10mm without other high-risk features is not significantly different from individuals without polyps at baseline. Lengthening surveillance intervals would affect 79% of high-risk individuals with ≥10mm polyps as their sole high-risk feature, and 46% if limited to those with 10-20mm polyps.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Intraductal Cryobiopsy via Percutaneous Cholangioscopy for Biliary Strictures: a Multicenter Feasibility Study.\r\nThis feasibility study showed that intraductal cryobiopsy via percutaneous cholangioscopy yielded larger samples and may enable more detailed histologic assessment than forceps biopsies. Further studies will evaluate its accuracy, safety, and potential for use with peroral cholangioscopy during ERCP.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Gastroenterology\r\n    Comparative Efficacy of Advanced Therapies for Management of Moderate-to-Severe Crohn's Disease: 2025 AGA Evidence Synthesis.\r\nUsing Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation to appraise quality of evidence, this updated network meta-analysis can inform positioning of advanced therapies for the treatment of biologic-naïve and biologic-exposed patients with moderate-to-severe CD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Intestinal LKB1 Loss Drives a Premalignant Program Along the Serrated Cancer Pathway.\r\nHeterozygous loss of LKB1 pushes intestinal cells into a chronic regenerative state, which is amplified on loss of heterozygosity. Lkb1 deficiency thereby generates fertile ground for serrated colorectal cancer formation in the intestine, potentially explaining the increased cancer risk observed in PJS.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Retraction Notice to: \"CSF1 Restores Innate Immunity After Liver Injury in Mice and Serum Levels Indicate Outcomes of Patients With Acute Liver Failure\" Gastroenterology 2015;149:1896-1909.e14.\r\nThe authors requested that this paper be retracted in 2019, and the Editors of Gastroenterology agree that this manuscript should be retracted. Dr Daniel Antoine played no part in any other aspects of this manuscript, and the authors have confidence in al other data.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Gastrointest Endosc\r\n    Best practices for Endoscopic Ultrasound-guided Gastroenterostomy: technical recommendations from an International modified Delphi process.\r\nDespite technical differences (such as the preference of a jejunal catheter or a double-balloon catheter) most EUS-GE experts agree on key technical principles, providing valuable guidance on the standardization of EUS-GE in clinical practice. Conversely, certain topics show limited agreement, identifying future research priorities in the field of EUS-GE.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Extended Surveillance After Piecemeal Endoscopic Mucosal Resection: A Safe Approach to Initial Surveillance in Low-Risk Patients.\r\n A risk-stratified approach may safely extend surveillance to 12 months for lower-risk patients following piecemeal EMR, reducing unnecessary procedures without compromising care.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Peroral cholangioscopy-guided laser-stricturoplasty for intrahepatic benign biliary strictures (with video).\r\n This pilot study suggests that POCS-LAS is a technically feasible and potentially effective treatment for intrahepatic BBS.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Gut\r\n    PDE5A<sup>+<\/sup> cancer-associated fibroblasts enhance immune suppression in gastric cancer.\r\nOur study elucidates the intricate role of PDE5A + CAFs in shaping the immunosuppressive TME in GC, providing mechanistic insights and therapeutic potential for combating this aggressive malignancy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx SMYD2-mediated methylation of STAT1 protects against hepatic ischaemia/reperfusion injury by blocking JAK-STAT1 signalling pathways.\r\n This study establishes SMYD2 as a novel negative regulator of STAT1 activity through K175 methylation, providing new insights into the epigenetic control of STAT1 during hepatic I/R injury. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognised mechanism for fine-tuning STAT1 signalling in hepatic I/R injury, and targeting the SMYD2-STAT1 axis may present a promising therapeutic strategy for mitigating I/R-associated liver damage.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx iPSC-induced multilineage liver organoids, small intestinal organoids and brain organoids sustain pangenotype hepatitis E virus propagation.\r\n This study established iPSC-induced multilineage organoid infection models, confirming HEV's capacity for pan-tissue infection and revealing potential pathogenic mechanisms in the liver, intestine and nervous system. This platform provides valuable tools for HEV virology research and antiviral drug development, underscoring the unique value of organoid technology in infectious disease research.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Hepatology\r\n    Glutamine synthetase loss in β-catenin-mutant hepatocellular carcinoma promotes tumor burden through macrophage metabolic reprogramming.\r\nWe demonstrate unique metabolic dependency of β-catenin-mutated HCCs on GS in tumor cells which is diverted to macrophages upon GS elimination in tumor cells. This adaptation alters macrophage metabolism and function leading to compromised immunosurveillance and greater tumor burden. Our study reveals a metabolic dynamic between HCC cells and macrophages with impact on tumor biology.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Hepatectomy alters adjuvant anti-PD-1 action in a mouse model of HCC but does not compromise neoadjuvant efficacy.\r\nPartial hepatectomy disrupts antitumor immunity and limits adjuvant ICI efficacy. Neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 immunotherapy offers a superior strategy compared to adjuvant immunotherapy in enhancing immune responses and reducing HCC recurrence.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx MSR1+ macrophages passivate antitumor immunity by inducing ITM2A+ CD4T exhaustion differentiation.\r\nMSR1+macrophages promote tumor-infiltrating ITM2A+CD4T exhaustion differentiation by regulating the ITM2A-ZAP70 axis. ZEA-αCD4 specifically targeted MSR1-ITM2A interaction to activate antitumor immunity and improve the efficacy of αPDL1 immunotherapy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Reclassifying pediatric NAFLD using the steatotic liver disease framework: a multicenter retrospective study from the NASH CRN.\r\nMost children with NAFLD met MASLD criteria, but nearly 1 in 6 were reclassified based on alcohol use or medication exposure. These findings highlight the need for a systematic diagnostic approach accounting for metabolic risk factors, alcohol use, and medication-related liver injury.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Serum bile acid levels predict the development of portal hypertension and high-risk esophageal varices following successful Kasai in biliary atresia.\r\n In biliary atresia patients with successful KP, sBA is an early biomarker predicting the development of PH and HRV within 5 years post-KP.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx J Hepatol\r\n    HBx-induced HSPB1 is a potential therapeutic target owing to its modulation of HBV cccDNA and hepatic immune responses.\r\nHSPB1 represents a novel therapeutic target by modulating HBV cccDNA and immune responses in the liver. D-TK is a promising clinical candidate for HBV treatment through cccDNA suppression and immune activation. Impact and implications Chronic infection with HBV remains a significant global health concern, and current therapeutic options are inadequate. In this study, we demonstrate that HBx-induced elevation of HSPB1 contributes to the regulation of HBV cccDNA and the hepatic immune responses. We engineered a peptide, D-TK, that targets HBx, effectively suppresses cccDNA, and activates immune responses through HSPB1. Our findings offer new insights into the mechanism by which HBx-induced HSPB1 modulates HBV cccDNA and immune regulation in the liver.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Microbial metabolism dysfunction induced by transarterial chemoembolization aggravates postprocedural liver injury in HCC.\r\nThis is the first study to identify gut microbiota disturbance, i.e., deficiency of L. reuteri metabolite ILA, as significant cause of TACE-LI. L. reuteri and ILA administration serves as promising therapeutic approach for TACE-LI, which is crucial for reducing TACE adverse effects to achieve better prognosis in HCC. Impact and implications The majority of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are diagnosed losing the chance of surgical resection. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is widely used for treating unresectable HCC;  however, its long-term outcome is significantly limited by its main complication, i.e., liver injury (LI). In addition to traditional cognition of the direct liver damage of the ischemic necrosis or regional chemotherapy induced by TACE, the deeper mechanisms underlying TACE-induced LI (TACE-LI) remain largely unclear. Gut microbiota can modulate various liver diseases but its exact role in TACE-LI has not been reported. We found that TACE could disturb the gut microbiota. This disturbance was characterized by reduced levels of Limosilactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) and its metabolite indole-3-lactic acid (ILA), which were correlated with aggravated TACE-LI and poor overall survival in HCC. Administration of L. reuteri or ILA significantly improved TACE-LI by inhibiting the inflammation of macrophages. Our study is the first report highlighting gut microbiota disturbances as an important cause of TACE-LI;  administration of L. reuteri or ILA represents a viable and secure strategy for preventing TACE-LI, thereby reducing the adverse effects of TACE and yielding better prognoses in patients with HCC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are

DSI is an excellent negative predictor, although not an independent risk factor. The NCCN/ESMO guideline has medium sensitivity and requires improvement. The JSCCR/FICPG guideline has perfect sensitivity but low specificity, thus exposing patients to many unnecessary surgeries. There is revision potential for current guideline factors, including those beyond current pathological ones, to improve LNM prediction accuracy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMCEndoscopy\r\n    Time trends in post-polypectomy surveillance guideline adherence: analysis of over 90 000 colonoscopies with polypectomy.\r\nAn improvement of up to 49% in ESGE guideline adherence was observed over 4 years after publication of the update, which was mostly driven by improved adherence to the surveillance intervals for adenomas. Endoscopists with higher ADRs were more likely to assign correct follow-up intervals.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx J Hepatol\r\n    Consensus position statements for the standardized application of histological grading and staging systems in MASH clinical trials.\r\n The IMPG statements provide for the first time guidelines to promote consensus among liver pathologists for the histopathological evaluation and scoring of liver biopsies for MASH clinical trials. Furthermore, they may be used to inform supervised machine learning algorithms for quantitative MASLD histology assessments. Impact and implications Inter- (and intra-) observer variations in the histological interpretation of key morphological features of MASH limit the precision of histological grading and staging as well as the diagnosis of the histological MASLD types, MASL and MASH. This is thought to account in clinical trials, at least in part, for screening failure as well as variable placebo response rates, potentially obscuring treatment effects. The International MASLD Pathology Group, consisting of 25 expert liver pathologists, generated consensus statements for histopathological procedures, technical aspects and histological criteria for the diagnosis of MASH, for grading disease activity and staging fibrosis. These may provide a basis for standardized histologic interpretation and the development of AI-based grading and staging algorithms for clinical trials of MASH.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx J Neurogastroenterol Motil\r\n    Treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome With Antispasmolytics in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Vietnam: A Delphi Expert Consensus Statement.\r\nAlthough antispasmolytics provide immediate symptom relief, their long-term effectiveness needs further investigations in Asian populations. Our findings may inform clinical decision-making and guideline updates.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\nMeta-analysis\r\nmeta-analyses and systematic reviews\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Meta-Analysis: Efficacy and Safety of Sequestrants for Bile Acid Diarrhoea.\r\nThis study quantifies the significant and rapid improvement in both stool consistency and frequency with BAS in patients with objective diagnosis of bile acid diarrhoea. Sequestrants also appear well tolerated.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Meta-Analysis: Utilisation of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Surveillance.\r\nLess than 10% of patients received the recommended biannual ultrasound scans for surveillance. These findings are concerning and call for greater awareness and collaboration between care providers and healthcare policymakers to improve surveillance utilisation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Non-Invasive Prediction Models of First Decompensation in Compensated Advanced Chronic Liver Disease - A Meta-Analysis.\r\nCACLD specific NITs offer the best option in predicting decompensation, and future studies should focus on robust validation, calibration and external validation with standardised endpoints to ensure that models are reliable for guiding clinical practice in applicable populations.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Placebo Rates in Metabolic Dysfunction-associated Steatohepatitis Clinical Trials: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.\r\n Placebo response rates among patients with MASH are generally elevated yet vary considerably depending on the outcome measured. This study provides valuable insights to enhance the design of future MASH trials.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Gastrointest Endosc\r\n    Clinical Impact of Routine Esophagram after Peroral Endoscopic Myotomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.\r\n Esophageal leakage is a very uncommon AE after POEM. Routine esophagram rarely impacted immediate post-procedural care in asymptomatic patients. Selective imaging may result in higher diagnostic yield, improved cost-efficiency, and mitigate the risk of unwarranted additional testing due to incidental radiographic findings.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Underwater vs Traction-assisted ESD in Colorectal Lesions Underwater versus Traction-assisted Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection for Colorectal Lesions: A Network Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.\r\n UW-ESD and T-ESD are both effective and safe strategies for colorectal lesions resection;  however, UW-ESD is the only technique that has demonstrated superior dissection speed.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal articles\r\nRCT, clinical trials, retrospective studies, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Biomarkers of Extracellular Matrix Remodelling Are Linked to Severity and Outcome of Advanced Chronic Liver Disease.\r\n ECM remodelling biomarkers reflect PH and disease severity in ACLD. Their prognostic value for disease progression is largely restricted to cACLD. Future studies should investigate whether repeated measurements improve risk stratification.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Clinical Trial: Rifaximin Versus Low FODMAP Diet in Irritable Bowel Syndrome.\r\n Rifaximin is as effective as LFD in treating IBS over 4 weeks. However, it provides faster symptom relief and higher treatment adherence, making it a practical alternative for symptom management.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Mild Endoscopic Disease Activity Is Associated With Adverse Outcomes Among Older Adults With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\nAmong older adults with prevalent IBD, mild endoscopic disease activity, as compared to endoscopic remission, was associated with increased odds of adverse IBD-specific and morbidity-related outcomes at 1 year, with this risk persisting for IBD-specific outcomes at 5 years. These findings highlight the importance of achieving endoscopic remission, which may confer both short- and longer-term benefits in this population.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Overall and Comparative Risk of Shingles With Advanced Therapies in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.\r\nJAK inhibitors were associated with 1.7-2.2-fold higher risk of shingles than other advanced therapies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Research Communication: An Observational Cohort Study on Risk of Ovarian Cancer in Women with Irritable Bowel Syndrome.\r\nSome women with symptoms of ovarian cancer may be misdiagnosed with IBS, although IBS is not causally linked to ovarian cancer. Further studies are needed to validate findings and clarify when ovarian cancer screening may be warranted.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Research Communication: Comparative Effectiveness of Ustekinumab and Vedolizumab in the Management of Chronic Pouchitis-A Population-Based Study.\r\n Our findings suggest that ustekinumab may offer advantages over vedolizumab in the management of chronic pouchitis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Research Communication: Prevalence of Asymptomatic Premalignant Oesophageal Lesions in Patients With Fanconi Anaemia.\r\nAmong 11 FA patients with abnormal oesophageal mucosa, 15% had low-grade dysplasia, nodular high-grade dysplasia or squamous carcinoma in situ, 10% had non-dysplastic Barrett's oesophagus and 30% had columnar epithelium without goblet cells, compared to none in the controls (p < 0.001). Our findings support routine EGD screening of asymptomatic FA patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMCSocial Determinants of Health in Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease and All-Cause/Cause-Specific Mortality.\r\nThis US population-based study demonstrates that SDoH scores are dose-dependently associated with increased all-cause/cause-specific mortality among individuals with MASLD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Am J Gastroenterol\r\n    An organized fecal immunochemical test-based screening program impacts colorectal cancer early diagnosis and survival in the short term.\r\n Biennial FIT led to an increase in early diagnoses and improved survival, compared to no screening, in the short term after its introduction. A screening program that includes alternatives to FIT may increase population coverage and improve CRC outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Assessing the reliability of 12 vs 24 hour esophageal pH-impedance monitoring for gastro-esophageal reflux in infants.\r\nEach MII-pH was analyzed twice as full-time recording and in the first 12h, and data were compared. GERD was diagnosed if one of the following occurred: Number of GER episodes ≥100 in 24 hours;  proximal GER episodes >44 (acid) or 57 (non-acid);  Reflux index (percent time with pH 5 minutes were significantly different between the two, but the clinical significance of this observation is unclear.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Delayed Remission With Advanced Therapies Is Not Associated With Worse One-Year Outcomes In Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\r\nAbout one-sixth of patients achieved delayed remission by week 30. They had comparable one-year outcomes as early remitters. Identifying predictors of delayed remission could help prevent early therapy discontinuation without affecting long-term outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx One versus five days of octreotide infusion for acute esophageal variceal bleeding: a randomized controlled trial.\r\nFollowing successful endoscopic band ligation, the 1-day regimen of octreotide had a non-inferior effect compared to the standard 5-day regimen in the prevention of 5-day re-bleeding and exhibited no significant differences in the prevention of 6-week re-bleeding and all-cause mortality.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF PNEUMATIC BALLOON DILATION FOR PEDIATRIC ACHALASIA - A SINGLE-CENTER EXPERIENCE.\r\n PD is a safe, effective first-line treatment for pediatric achalasia.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Validation of Dried Blood Spot Immunoreactive Trypsinogen (DBS-IRT) as a Biomarker of Exocrine Pancreas Function in Children with Pancreas Disease.\r\nDBS-IRT was successfully validated as a biomarker of exocrine pancreas function which allows its use in clinical setting, in addition to fecal elastase to determine pancreas function.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Vonoprazan Improves Nocturnal Gastroesophageal Reflux Symptoms in Non-Erosive Reflux Disease.\r\n Our study suggests that vonoprazan leads to relief of nighttime heartburn in patients with heartburn and a normal endoscopy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    AI-ASSISTED CAPSULE ENDOSCOPY FOR DETECTION OF ULCERS AND EROSIONS IN CROHN'S DISEASE: A MULTICENTER VALIDATION STUDY.\r\nThe AI-assisted SBCE reading achieved superior diagnostic performance compared to SoC, with a substantial decrease in reading time.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Changes in HBcAg and HBsAg Expression Following Antiviral Therapy and Their Role in Outcome of Patients with Chronic Hepatitis B.\r\nNA-related inhibition of viral replication was associated with marked reduction in HBcAg expression in HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients but minimal changes in extent of HBsAg staining, likely reflecting HBsAg production from integrated HBV DNA.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Experienced Discrimination and Medical Mistrust Among Patients with Cirrhosis: Survey Results from a Multicenter Cohort.\r\n Experienced discrimination and medical mistrust are common among Black patients with cirrhosis. Addressing these factors may mitigate racial and ethnic inequities in care, reduce barriers to care and improve outcomes for patients with cirrhosis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx From Pixels to Peristalsis: Comparing Achalasia Diagnosis with Artificial Intelligence to Expert Endoscopists.\r\n These results indicate that AI can leverage upper endoscopy videos to detect achalasia with an accuracy comparable to that of expert endoscopists.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Long-Term Glycemic Control and the Risk of Liver Stiffness Progression and Liver-Related Events in MASLD.\r\nT2D was independently associated with a higher risk of liver stiffness progression and LRE in MASLD. Good glycemic control was associated with slower liver stiffness progression, but not regression or LRE.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Long-term safety of vedolizumab in patients with ulcerative colitis/Crohn's disease: A prospective observational study.\r\n There was no new safety signal identified in relation to vedolizumab. Results regarding safety and effectiveness were consistent with the known profile of vedolizumab.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Seroprevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection among asymptomatic patients served by a safety-net healthcare system.\r\n In this population-based study, almost two-thirds of asymptomatic patients were seropositive for H. pylori. Prevalence was over 40% among al sub-groups. Screening solely based on race and ethnicity may inadvertently exacerbate disparities by overlooking confounding factors for infection like low socioeconomic status and regional exposures.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Endosc Int Open\r\n    Endoscopic indigo carmine spraying for evaluation of intestinal mucosal permeability: Prospective pilot study.\r\nEndoscopic spraying with IC is useful for evaluation of intestinal mucosal permeability.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMCImpact of interaction between an artificial intelligence endoscopic support system and endoscopists on diagnosis of gastric neoplastic lesions.\r\nAI contributed to improved diagnostic performance even among Japanese expert endoscopists in detecting gastric neoplastic lesions. These findings suggest that the AI system may have potential to support consistently high diagnostic performance across varying levels of endoscopic expertise.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMCLarge language model for interpreting the Paris classification of colorectal polyps.\r\nM-LLMs performed comparably to endoscopists in distinguishing non-polypoid from polypoid lesions but failed to reliably identify pedunculated morphology.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMCEndoscopy\r\n    A Prospective Study Evaluating an Artificial Intelligence-Based System for Withdrawal Time Measurement.\r\n Our study demonstrates the superiority of an AI system in calculating WT during colonoscopy compared to physicians, providing significant improvements, especially in examinations containing interventions.

Therefore, we suggest continuation of high-dose ATT for colonoscopy indications with a low risk of detecting advanced polyps.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Endoscopic papillectomy for ampullary lesions: pooled analysis with meta-regression analysis of outcomes.\r\n Endoscopic papillectomy is a safe and effective treatment for ampullary lesions. However, lesions with intraductal extension pose a higher risk of incomplete resection and perforation, warranting careful evaluation of the benefit-risk balance in these cases.While prophylactic pancreatic stenting may reduce the incidence of post-procedural pancreatitis, optimizing strategies to minimize overall adverse events remains a key focus for future research.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Endoscopic ultrasound-guided trans-papillary versus trans-luminal biliary stenting: Randomized comparison of long term stent patency.\r\n EUS-BD via TP route achieved longer stent patency and lower rate of recurrent biliary obstruction at 3 and 6 months compared to TL route.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Impact of prophylactic clipping on delayed bleeding after colorectal endoscopic submucosal dissection: a multicenter propensity score-matched study.\r\nIn our cohort, prophylactic clipping did not significantly reduce CSDB following colorectal ESD, even in high-risk patients. Given its environmental impact and technical challenges, routine closure should be reconsidered.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Gastrointest Endosc\r\n    Cystic Fibrosis Carrier Status: A genetic predisposition to post-ERCP pancreatitis.\r\n CFC status appears to increase predisposition to PEP, highlighting the potential for improved pre-procedural risk assessment and prophylaxis and opportunities for further study to identify novel PEP prophylactic strategies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Lumen-Apposing Metal Stents for Partial Reversal of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: A Multicenter Study.\r\n EUS-guided LAMS placement is a safe, efficacious and minimally invasive strategy for partial reversal of RYGB as either a bridge to definitive surgical reversal or as destination therapy.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing the Clinical Efficacy of a Bipolar Current Knife versus Monopolar Current Knife During Esophageal PerOral Endoscopic Myotomy: A Multicenter Non-inferiority Study.\r\n77% of patients in BC completed the entire procedure with one instrument vs none in MC. Only one major adverse event occurred in BC (managed endoscopically) (1.9%) CONCLUSION: The 3-in-1 function of a novel bipolar RFA knife can facilitate POEM with one device.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Sequential Lumen-Apposing Metal Stent and Septotomy Technique for Endoscopic Anastomosis Creation and Revision in Patients with Prior Upper Gastrointestinal Surgery.\r\nOur technique is safe, effective, and feasible for durable endoscopic anastomosis creation or revision in appropriately selected patients with prior upper GI surgery.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx The Effect of Autonomous Mobile Robots on Improving Endoscope Reprocessing Efficiency: A Prospective Comparative Trial.\r\nAMR-assisted endoscope delivery has advantages over manual delivery in efficiency improvement, offering a novel solution for the management of endoscopy centers.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Transenteric ERCP via EUS-guided anastomosis using LAMS in patients with surgically altered anatomy.\r\n The EDEE technique offers a new and effective approach for biliary drainage in patients with surgically altered anatomy, particularly in benign indications and/or when several ERCPs are expected.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Gut\r\n    KIF1Bβ suppresses hepatocellular carcinoma by transporting and secreting FBLN5 to attenuate the integrin pathway.\r\nOur findings shed light on the genetic and molecular mechanisms of the HCC-associated susceptibility locus at 1p36.22 and provide potential new strategies for the treatment of HCC.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Long-term prognosis of lean MASLD: evidence from three population-based prospective cohorts.\r\n Lean patients with MASLD have worse liver outcomes and greater risk of all-cause mortality, but similar risk of HCC and extrahepatic cancer, and lower CVD risk.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Rectal versus colonic submucosal cancer rates and procedural outcomes in large non-pedunculated polyps: French ESD registry data.\r\n In our multicentre registry, large non-pedunculated polyps do not show a higher prevalence of SMIC in the rectum compared with colon, when adjusted for relevant factors such as size and morphology. Therefore, risk features, rather than location, should guide the choice of resection technique. Technical outcomes were comparable between rectal and colonic ESD, with a trend for higher complication rates in the colon.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Hepatology\r\n    Global performance of non-invasive tests in MASLD: Insights from the G-MASLD study.\r\n Diagnostic performance of common non-invasive tests for fibrosis in MASLD varies across the world.

Impact and implications Portopulmonary hypertension (PoPH) is a severe and often overlooked complication of cirrhosis. Using the updated 2022 ESC/ERS diagnostic criteria, this multicenter study identified a previously unrecognized subgroup of cirrhotic patients with early-stage PoPH, defined by mildly elevated pulmonary vascular resistance and mean pulmonary artery pressure. Despite their subtle hemodynamic changes, these patients showed significantly reduced survival, independent of liver disease severity. These results highlight the prognostic relevance of early PoPH and suggest that applying the new criteria may help refine risk stratification and guide closer follow-up or earlier consideration of targeted interventions in selected patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx Genetically engineered pig-to-human liver xenotransplantation.\r\nThis study demonstrates the feasibility of auxiliary porcine liver xenotransplantation as a bridging approach to human to liver transplantation. Postoperative xTMA presents a significant challenge to long-term success, highlighting the need for further research to improve xenotransplantation outcomes. Impact and implications This study reports the world's first auxiliary xenotransplantation from a 10-gene-edited pig to a living human recipient - distinct from previous studies involving brain-dead donors. The donor liver was engineered using a 10-gene editing platform, including the knockout of xenoantigen genes and the knock-in of seven human transgenes for immune and coagulation compatibility - pushing the boundaries of synthetic biology in clinical transplantation. The porcine graft exhibited metabolically active liver function, bile secretion, and coagulation correction, demonstrating not only survival but clinically meaningful function. Our work documents, for the first time, xenotransplantation-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (xTMA) in a living human recipient, with comprehensive immunological and histopathological analysis - critical knowledge for the field.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx J Neurogastroenterol Motil\r\n    Age- and Sex-dependent Effects of High-fructose, High-fat Diets on Small Bowel Inflammation and Hepatic Steatosis in F344 Rats.\r\nLiver and small bowel tissues were histologically analyzed.
