However, more patients had improvement in abdominal bloating, which was associated with a reduction in hydrogen sulphide-producing bacteria. (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03125564).\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAm J Gastroenterol\r\n    Chicago Classification v4.0 stratifies acid burden and abnormal impedance-pH variables better than Chicago Classification v3.0.\r\n CCv4.0 hypomotility criteria are more specific in supporting GERD evidence compared to CCv3.0.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nVirtual Reality Improves Symptoms of Functional Dyspepsia: Results of a Randomized, Double-Blind, Sham-Controlled, Pilot Study.\r\n Virtual reality is safe and results in significant symptom improvement in FD. Larger trials are warranted.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Age-dependent Female Survival Advantage in Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Multicenter Cohort Study.\r\n Female survival advantage in HCC depends on age, and this may be associated with age-dependent sex-specific factors.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nComparative effectiveness of biologic therapies in preventing penetrating complications in patients with Crohn's disease.\r\n Anti-TNF therapy was associated with a lower risk of LPD and PPD compared with VDZ, and lower risk of LPD compared with UST. Further studies are needed to validate these findings and to determine potential reasons for these differences.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nIncidence of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Urban China: A Nationwide Population-Based Study.\r\nThis study is the first to draw a portrait of the distribution of IBD in urban China. The difference in IBD incidence between urban China and other countries suggests an association between the IBD burden and industrialization process. The accelerating urbanization and industrialization process in China, a country with a population of 1.4 billion people, will likely increase the burden of IBD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReal-world efficacy of dupilumab in severe, treatment-refractory, and fibrostenotic patients with eosinophilic esophagitis.\r\nIn this population of severe, refractory, and fibrostenotic EoE patients, most achieved histologic, endoscopic, and symptom improvement with a median of 6 months of dupilumab, and esophageal stricture diameter improved. Dupilumab has real world efficacy for a severe EoE population, most of whom would not have qualified for prior clinical trials.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndosc Int Open\r\n    Comparison of guidewires for successful cannulation of biliary stenosis and targeting of biliary branches in ERCP.\r\nThe results of this model test, which focused on the time required to complete the course around the model, can serve as a foundation for guidewire selection. This method holds potential utility in future guidewire development.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPerforation-free removal of gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumors: Endoscopic inversion and strangulation of muscle layer and resection (EISMR).\r\nThe median procedure time was 93 min (range, 58-120 min), and there were no major complications. We concluded that EISMR would be a safe and effective technique for endoscopic resection of gastric GISTs and may be an alternative to surgery or endoscopic submucosal dissection.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    A Tissue Systems Pathology Test Outperforms Pathology Review in Risk Stratifying Patients with Low-Grade Dysplasia.\r\nThe TSP-9 test outperformed the pathologists in risk-stratifying BE patients with LGD.

However, most patients with CP and pancreatic cancer transitioned directly from a healthy state.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointest Endosc\r\n    Endoscopic construction of an anti-reflux mucosal barrier for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease, a pilot study.\r\nARMV is a safe, feasible and effective procedure for GERD patients in this pilot study. Further prospective and comparative trials are needed to confirm its role among endoscopic anti-reflux therapies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe carbon cost of inappropriate endoscopy.\r\nThe environmental impact of inappropriate endoscopic procedures in Italy and Europe is remarkable. These results highlight the need to adopt novel strategies aimed at reducing both the carbon footprint of digestive endoscopy and the rate of inappropriate procedures.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    Endoluminal radiofrequency ablation in patients with malignant biliary obstruction: a randomised trial.\r\n A combination of endoluminal RFA and stenting was not superior to stenting alone in prolonging survival or improving stent patency in patients with malignant biliary obstruction.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPredicting residual neoplasia after a non-curative gastric ESD: validation and modification of the eCura system in the Western setting: the W-eCura score.\r\n The eCura scoring system may be applied in Western countries to stratify the risk of LNM after a gastric HRR. A new score is proposed that may further decrease the number of unnecessary surgeries.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    LIM domain only 7 negatively controls non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in the setting of hyperlipidaemia.\r\nThese findings provide proof-of-concept evidence supporting LMO7 as a robust suppressor of NASH in the context of hyperlipidemia, indicating that targeting the LMO7-TRIM47 axis is a promising therapeutic strategy for NASH.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nLack of complete biochemical response in autoimmune hepatitis leads to adverse outcome: first report of the IAIHG retrospective registry.\r\n The IAIHG-RR represents the world's largest AIH cohort with moderate-to-good data quality and a relevant number of liver-related events. The registry is a suitable platform for patient selection in future studies. Lack of complete biochemical response to treatment, non-white ethnicity, cirrhosis and PSC-AIH were associated with liver-related death and liver transplantation.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPegylated interferon-a for chronic hepatitis B…not ready to be shelved yet! new insights on its role using single-cell transcriptomics.\r\nThe current editorial reviews a recent study related to the in-vivo use of PegIFN-a using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology. PegIFN-a reverts the transcriptome profile of treated samples close to that of the healthy population, diminishing the pro-inflammatory genes and 'inflammatory scores' which will be important for the HBV-cure program.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    A+T rich interaction domain protein 3a (Arid3a) impairs Mertk-mediated efferocytosis in cholestasis.\r\nArid3a promotes cholestatic liver injury via impairing Mertk-mediated efferocytosis of apoptotic cholangiocytes by macrophages during cholestasis. The Arid3a-Mertk axis is a novel promising therapeutic target for cholestatic liver diseases. Impact and implications Macrophages play an important role in the pathogenesis of cholestatic liver diseases. This study reveals that macrophages with Arid3a upregulation manifest a pro-inflammatory phenotype and promote cholestatic liver injury by impairing Mertk-mediated efferocytosis of apoptotic cholangiocytes during cholestasis. Although we now offer a new paradigm how efferocytosis is regulated in a myeloid cell autonomous manner, the regulatory effects of Arid3a on chronic liver diseases remain to be further elucidated.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the publisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Endosc Int Open\r\n    Low-grade dysplasia on Barrett's esophagus: visible or not ?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Are the \"ELEMENTS\" Fulfilled for Adoption of EUS-Guided Choledochoduodenostomy as a First-Line Modality?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastric Intestinal Metaplasia: Real Culprit or Innocent Bystander as a Precancerous Condition for Gastric Cancer?\r\nEndoscopic surveillance for GIM may therefore be necessary, especially when there is extensive corpus GIM. Recent advances in image-enhanced endoscopy with integrated artificial intelligence have facilitated the identification of GIM and neoplastic lesions, which will impact preventive strategies in the near future.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nTSP-9: A Barrett's esophagus biomarker better than pathologists?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    Abnormal gastrointestinal motility is a major factor in explaining symptoms and a potential therapeutic target in patients with disorders of gut-brain interaction.\r\nFor each section regarding GI motor dysfunction, the article describes the preferred methods and the documented motor dysfunctions in DGBI based on those methods. The predominantly non-invasive measurements of gut motility as well as therapeutic interventions directed to abnormalities of motility suggest that such measurements are to be considered in patients with DGBI not responding to first-line approaches to behavioural or empirical dietary or pharmacological treatment.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous\r\nmisc publications eg case reports, tools of the trade, images of the month, etc…\r\n\r\n\r\n    Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Comparative Effectiveness of Upadacitinib Versus Ustekinumab for Ulcerative Colitis: A Multicenter Retrospective Cohort Study.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nNatural Evolution of Pancreatic Serous Cystadenoma on EUS (with Video).\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndosc Int Open\r\n    Piercing technique for mucosal hyperplasia at an uncovered part of a partially covered stent after endoscopic ultrasound-guided hepaticogastrostomy.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nSimple endoscopic transpapillary gallbladder aspiration/irrigation using a double-pigtail plastic stent system.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopy\r\n    Endoscopic closure of a rectovaginal fistula following surgery for endometriosis using the MARCEAU system.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopic ultrasound-guided reintervention for biliary metal stent kinking using a device delivery system.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    A Chain Reaction to dysphagia.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nA Woman with Pyoderma Gangrenosum, Recurrent Abdominal Pain, and Hematochezia.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAnonymous Living Donor Liver Transplantation: The Altruistic Strangers.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nDiagnosing the Struggling Fellow.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGenetic Defect in Submucosal Gland Associated Caveolin-3: A New Paradigm in Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Risk.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRisk of cancer and mortality in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and Juvenile Polyposis Syndrome - a nationwide cohort study with matched controls.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    Enolase: a metabolic checkpoint behind diverse exhaustion stages of CD8+ T cells in chronic HBV and HCV.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    Letter to the Editor: NAFLD, MAFLD or MASLD? cut the Gordian knot with \"Ludwig disease\".\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nReply: NAFLD, MAFLD or MASLD? cut the gordian knot with \"Ludwig disease\".\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe chronicles of hepatocellular carcinoma classification: Subtyping, modeling and treatment.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetters&Replies\r\nLetters to the editors and authors’ replies\r\n\r\n\r\n    Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    \"Secondary prevention of esophageal variceal bleeding: Still a long way to go, but the direction is obvious\".\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAustralasian insights and perspectives on the burden of Chronic Liver Disease.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGlucagon-like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists: Best Choice for Patients with Cirrhosis and Diabetes?\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    ALKBH5 in Colorectal Cancer: An insufficiently explored and controversial research area.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Clinicaltrial gov  NCT03634098.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRisk and predictors of hepatic decompensation in grey zone patients by the Baveno VII criteria: A competing risk analysis.\r\nPatients in grey zone of Baveno VII criteria remain at high risk of hepatic decompensation. Clinical risk factors and spleen stiffness can further stratify the risk in such patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nAm J Gastroenterol\r\n    A Review of Available Medical Therapies to Treat Moderate to Severe Inflammatory Bowel Disease in 2023.\r\nAdditionally, safety considerations and use in special populations is summarized with proposed algorithms for positioning therapies. The aim is to provide a synopsis of high impact data and aid in outpatient treatment decision making for IBD patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nEndoscopist and procedure-level factors associated with increased adenoma detection with the use of a computer-aided detection (CADe) device.\r\nThe application of CADe devices in clinical practice should be carefully evaluated. Larger studies should explore differences in endoscopist-related factors for CADe.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nInterventional Endoscopic Ultrasound: Current Status and Future Frontiers.\r\nInterventional Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) has fueled remarkable advancements in the field of therapeutic procedures, revolutionizing minimally invasive interventions for a diverse range of conditions. This review highlights the latest breakthroughs and advancements in therapeutic EUS, showcasing its potential to transform patient care.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    COLORECTAL CANCER STAGE-DISTRIBUTION AT FIRST AND REPEAT FECAL IMMUNOCHEMICAL TEST SCREENING.\r\n FIT-based screening is effective in downstaging CRC, also at repeat screening. Increasing the FIT cut-off level has limited impact on the stage-distribution of detected CRCs, though greatly affects CRC detection and thus is important to keep low.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastroenterology\r\n    Development and validation of a post-radiotherapy prediction model for bowel dysfunction after rectal cancer resection.\r\nPORTLARS could predict major bowel dysfunction after rectal cancer resection following radiotherapy with high accuracy and robustness.

The hypoxia microenvironment might contribute to the crosstalk between PACs and PSCs in pathogenesis of CP.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe natural disease course of pancreatic cyst associated neoplasia, dysplasia, and ductal adenocarcinoma; results of a microsimulation model.\r\n The mean duration of HGD lesions prior to development of PC was estimated to be 4.0 years. This implies a window of opportunity for screening, presuming the availability of a reliable diagnostic test. The probability that LGD cyst will progress to cancer was predicted to be low.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGut\r\n    Endoluminal radiofrequency ablation in patients with malignant biliary obstruction: a randomised trial.\r\n A combination of endoluminal RFA and stenting was not superior to stenting alone in prolonging survival or improving stent patency in patients with malignant biliary obstruction.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nGastrointestinal syndromes preceding a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease: testing Braak's hypothesis using a nationwide database for comparison with Alzheimer's disease and cerebrovascular diseases.\r\n Dysphagia, gastroparesis, IBS without diarrhoea and constipation might specifically predict Parkinson's disease.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatology\r\n    HDV RNA Assays: Performance characteristics, clinical utility and challenges.\r\nWe summarize distinct technical features and performance characteristics of available HDV RNA assays. Finally, we provide considerations for the use of HDV RNA assays in the context of drug development and patient monitoring.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatocellular carcinoma reduced, HBsAg loss increased and survival improved after finite therapy in hepatitis B patients with cirrhosis.\r\nFinite Nuc therapy in HBeAg-negative HBV-LC may reduce HCC incidence, increase HBsAg loss and improve survival. Greater HBsAg decline/loss may reflect enhanced immunity and contribute to the reduction of hepatic carcinogenesis.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nImpact of PNPLA3 I148M on alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency-dependent liver disease progression.\r\n Our results demonstrate that the PNPLA3 polymorphism in the absence of additional metabolic risk factors is insufficient to drive the development of advanced liver disease in severe alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRefractory hepatic hydrothorax is associated with increased mortality with death occurring at lower MELD-Na compared to cirrhosis and refractory ascites.\r\nRH was associated with higher risk of LRD than RA at equivalent MELD-Na. By contrast, MELD 3.0 may better predict risk of LRD in RH.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    Familial Coaggregation of MASLD with Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Adverse Liver Outcomes: Nationwide Multigeneration Cohort Study.\r\nThere is distinct familial clustering of adverse liver-related outcomes in families of individuals with biopsy-proven MASLD with higher relative risks of HCC, progressive liver disease, and liver-related mortality, but absolute risks are low. Impact and implications Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD;  formerly termed Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease;  NAFLD) clusters in families with high genetic susceptibility and shared environmental risk factors, but the risks of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other major liver-related outcomes in family members of individuals with MASLD are largely unknown. This large nationwide multigeneration cohort study involving family members (first-degree relatives and spouses) of individuals with biopsy-proven MASLD and of matched general population comparators found slightly increased risks of HCC in first-degree relatives, and of developing cirrhosis and liver-related mortality in al family members of individuals with biopsy-proven MASLD. The findings of this study provide large-scale evidence to inform clinical practice guidelines for recommendations on the early identification of individuals at higher risk of liver-related morbidity and mortality.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMolecular-based targeted therapies in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and hepato-cholangiocarcinoma refractory to atezolizumab/bevacizumab.\r\n Molecular-based guided therapy is feasible in patients with HCC/H-CCK progressing under atezolizumab/bevacizumab and may be useful in a small subset of patients. Impact and implications Whole genome/exome and RNA sequencing in clinical practice have never been previously reported in patients with HCC and H-CCK. Herein, we provided a pilot study suggesting that Whole genome/exome RNA sequencing is feasible on tumor biopsy in patients refractory to atezolizumab/bevacizumab with a small subset of the patients with at least one actionable genomic alteration and who received an adapted targeted therapy. This is a proof-of-concept study suggesting that a small subset of patients have a clinical benefit from this strategy. Finally, validation of this approach will be required in a larger cohort of patients.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Neurogastroenterol Motil\r\n    Achalasia and Hiatal Hernia: A Rare Association and a Therapeutic Challenge.\r\nHiatal hernia is rarely associated with achalasia. The presence of a hiatal hernia should not influence treatment decisions in patients with achalasia.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the publisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Editorial: If STRIDE-II is the hammer, then Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are not the same nails.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nRecent advances in fibrosis assessment for metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nClin Gastroenterol Hepatol\r\n    Blue Notes.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCurrent Pharmacologic Therapies for Hepatorenal Syndrome-Acute Kidney Injury.\r\nOur current understanding of HRS treatment is improved by recent randomized clinical trials. Previous studies using varying medication doses along with the \"old\" definition of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS type 1) rather than HRS-AKI means that there is still a need for future multicenter prospective studies further refining the risk-benefit ratio of vasoconstrictors for HRS-AKI patients. The Food and Drug Administration has approved terlipressin for use in September 2022. Because it will take time to adapt into clinical practice, less cost-prohibitive vasoconstrictors should still be considered. Opportunities also exist to clarify the safety, timing of initiation, as well as possible discontinuation of terlipressin.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nHepatorenal Syndrome-Acute Kidney Injury in Liver Transplantation.\r\nTerlipressin has been shown to reverse HRS-AKI in a significant proportion of those treated and consequently can lead to increased LT patient survival and freedom from renal replacement therapy. We will review the impact of HRS on the management of patients awaiting LT, present strategies to prevent this significant complication, and discuss major implications of recent therapeutic advances in the setting of LT.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nPathophysiology of Hepatorenal Syndrome - Acute Kidney Injury.\r\nOther contributing factors to renal dysfunction include the tubular damaging effects of cholestasis and adrenal dysfunction. Future developments include the use of metabolomics to identify metabolic pathways that can lead to the development of renal dysfunction, with the potential of identifying biomarkers for early diagnosis of renal dysfunction and the development of treatment strategies.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nResearch Considerations in Digestive and Liver Disease in Transgender and Gender-Diverse Populations.\r\n\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe Diagnosis and Non-pharmacological Management of Acute Kidney Injury in Patients with Cirrhosis.\r\nThe diagnosis and early institution of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management are key to the recovery of renal function.

Public health initiatives addressing CE may be considered to reduce mortality, particularly in areas of high social vulnerability.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nMetabolic reprogramming in Nrf2-driven proliferation of normal rat hepatocytes.\r\n Many metabolic changes in cancer cells are shared by proliferating normal hepatocytes in response to a hostile environment. Nrf2 activation is essential for bridging metabolic changes with crucial components of cancer metabolic reprogramming including the activation of oxidative PPP. Our study demonstrates that matured hepatocytes exposed to LN undergo a cancer-like metabolic reprogramming and offers a rapid and useful in vivo model to study the molecular alterations underpinning the differences/similarities of metabolic changes in normal and neoplastic hepatocytes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe global fatty liver disease Sustainable Development Goal country score for 195 countries and territories.\r\nThe fatty liver disease-SDG score provides a strategic advocacy tool at the national and global levels for the liver health field and noncommunicable disease advocates, highlighting the multisectoral collaborations needed to address fatty liver disease, and noncommunicable diseases overall.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx   PMC\r\nThe utility of P-I-R classification in predicting the on-treatment histological and clinical outcomes of patients with hepatitis B and advanced liver fibrosis.\r\nThe P-I-R classification can be a meaningful complementary to the Ishak fibrosis score not only in evaluating the histological changes but also in predicting the clinical outcomes.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Hepatol\r\n    A fetal wound healing program after intrauterine bile duct injury may contribute to biliary atresia.\r\n The fetal/neonatal EHBD, including in human EHBD remnants from Kasai surgeries, demonstrated an injury response with prolonged high levels of HA typical of fetal wound healing. The expanded peri-luminal HA layer may swell and lead to elevated bilirubin levels and obstruction of the EHBD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nBiliary atresia is associated with polygenic susceptibility in ciliogenesis and planar polarity effector genes.\r\nBiliary atresia is associated with polygenic susceptibility in CPLANE genes. Rare variants contribute to polygenic risk in vulnerable pathways via unique genes. Impact and implications Liver transplantation is needed to cure most children born with biliary atresia, a poorly understood rare disease. Transplant immunosuppression increases the likelihood of life-threatening infections and cancers. To improve care by preventing this disease and its progression to transplantation, we examined its genetic basis. We find that this disease is associated with both common and rare mutations in highly specialised genes which maintain normal communication and movement of cells, and their organization into bile ducts and blood vessels during early development of the human embryo. Because defects in these genes also cause other birth defects, our findings can lead to preventive strategies to lower the incidence of biliary atresia and potentially other birth defects.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nCombined inhibition of surface CD51 and -secretase-mediated CD51 cleavage improves therapeutic efficacy in experimental metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.\r\nTo sum up, we revealed previously unrecognized action mechanisms of CD51 on HCC progression and uncovered the underlying cause of cilengitide treatment failure and supported the translational prospects of combined CD51-targeted therapy in the clinic. Impact and implications Integrin av (CD51) is a widely recognized pro-tumoral molecule that plays a crucial role in various stages of tumor progression, making it a promising therapeutic target. However, despite early promising results, cilengitide, a specific antagonist of CD51, surprisingly failed in the phase 3 clinical trial. This prompted further investigation into the underlying mechanisms. This study reveals that the -secretase complex directly cleaves CD51 to produce an intracellular domain (CD51-ICD), which functions as a pro-tumoral transcriptional regulator and can bypass the inhibitory effects of cilengitide by entering the nucleus. Furthermore, the localization of CD51 in the nucleus is significantly associated with the prognosis of patients with HCC. These findings provide a theoretical basis for re-evaluating cilengitide in clinical settings and highlight the importance of identifying a more precise patient subpopulation for future clinical trials targeting CD51.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nProgression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and long-term outcomes: A nationwide paired liver biopsy cohort study.\r\nIn a nationwide, real-world cohort of patients with paired NAFLD biopsies, histological disease progression contributed to significantly higher rates of developing incident ESLD, but did not appear to impact all-cause mortality. Impact and implications Currently, data are scarce regarding the long-term impact of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) histological progression or regression on subsequent risk of adverse clinical outcomes, including the development of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and mortality. This is particularly important because randomized controlled trials of NAFLD therapeutics currently focus on short-term histological endpoints as presumed surrogates for those major clinical outcomes. Thus, the results from this study can help inform the optimal design of future NAFLD therapeutic trials, while also providing the necessary evidence base for public health policies focused on preventing the development and progression of NAFLD.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nJ Neurogastroenterol Motil\r\n    A Higher Manometric Esophageal Length to Height Ratio in Achalasia Explains the Lower Prevalence of Hiatal Hernia.\r\nThe prevalence of HH in achalasia is significantly lower than in GERD. The longer EL and the higher MELH ratio in achalasia could explain the lower prevalence of HH. Despite the low prevalence of HH in achalasia patients, the surgeon should be encouraged not to rule out HH since the risk of postoperative reflux may increase if this condition is not identified and corrected.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\nThe imbalance of innate and adaptive immunity in esophageal achalasia.\r\n Patients with achalasia exhibited an imbalance of systematic innate and adaptive immunity, which may play an important role in the development of achalasia.\r\nPubmed   Journal   ReadQx \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews&Editorials\r\nPlenty of the editorials are available as full text through the publisher website using the provided link\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aliment Pharmacol Ther\r\n    Emerging and current management of acute-on-chronic liver failure.\r\n The recognition of ACLF as a distinct entity from acutely decompensated cirrhosis has allowed for better patient stratification in clinical settings, facilitating earlier engagement with the intensive care unit and liver transplantation teams.
